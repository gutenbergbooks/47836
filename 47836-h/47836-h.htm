<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">A short</span> time ago I published a popular
treatise on <cite>The Diseases of Woman</cite>, in the non pregnant
state, and in that work I announced my intention of shortly publishing
a similar one on <em>Pregnancy and its diseases</em>. This book is the
fulfilment of that promise.</p>

<p>Being the first <em>popular</em>, and yet strictly
<em>scientific</em> and <em>practical</em> book on Midwifery ever
published, its preparation has necessarily been a work of great labour
and difficulty. Everything had to be simplified; familiar explanations
had to be given of complicated processes, and illustrations had to
be designed that could be understood by my readers. Little or no
assistance could be obtained from other works on the subject, because
they were either designed for professional men; and therefore too
technical, or else were too general in their explanations, and too
unsystematical, to be of any practical use. I therefore had to write
every part afresh myself, and plan a new arrangement; and so difficult
was this to do, satisfactorily, that I have <em>twice before</em>
completed the whole work, and then commenced at the beginning again,
before I was satisfied with my own production.</p>

<p>As it now stands, I trust this treatise answers the purposes for
which it was intended. I have taken care to make it so complete, and
scientific, that a medical student may take it for his text book; and
at the same time I have endeavoured to so simplify it that any female,
of ordinary capacity, can fully understand both its explanations and
practical directions. All purely technical words have been avoided, or,
when absolutely necessary, they have been carefully explained. Every
topic connected with the main subjects has been discussed, and the
latest information given on every point, and from every source.</p>

<p>Such a work as this has long been needed. Females have been kept in
shameful ignorance, of everything connected with their own systems, and
of the wonderful phenomena in which they play so important a part. That
ignorance has led to untold evils, which can never be corrected till
they become more enlightened respecting themselves. Fortunately many
of them begin to see this, and they request, in behalf of themselves
and their sisters, that such knowledge be no longer withheld. I have
been now, for a long time, engaged in this pleasing task of female
instruction, both by my Lectures and books, and in my daily communion
with them as patients; I am therefore aware both of their great lack of
proper information, and of their strong desire for it, and I flatter
myself I also know, from experience and careful observation, the best
mode of imparting it to them. In fact, I have made it a matter of
careful study, not only to render my subject<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> <em>plain</em>, but also
<em>pleasing</em> and <em>unobjectionable</em>; so that the most
unreflecting shall feel an interest in it, and the most sensitive be
able to study it without pain or repugnance.</p>

<p>The object of this book is not to make <em>every</em> woman a
professional Midwife, nor to induce her to dispense with proper
assistance in her hour of difficulty, but simply to explain to her
the nature and manner of child-birth, and the means by which she
is to be assisted. This will disabuse her mind of many pernicious
errors&mdash;make her more patient under her unavoidable difficulties
and pains&mdash;more docile to what is required of her, since she
will see the <em>reason</em> for it&mdash;and it will also enable her
to avoid much positive suffering, and to render great help, in many
cases, to her attendant.&mdash;In a case of emergency also, when other
assistance cannot be procured time enough, or not at all, it will teach
one female how to assist another in delivery, which every one of them
ought to be able to do. Very often it happens that a case of this kind
occurs, and the Females around, instead of knowing how to help the
sufferer, are utterly useless, and even make her worse by their evident
terror and ignorance. I have known women <em>die</em> in child-bed,
for want of the most trivial assistance, which even a child could
understand how to give, though there were elderly females, mothers
themselves, around her; but they knew not what to do. Such a state
of things is disgraceful to the boasted intelligence of the age, and
should be remedied as speedily as possible. Every Adult female, or at
least every married one, should be instructed in these things, so that
she may know how to regulate her own conduct and how to render useful
assistance to others in case of need. Ill informed women are generally
as apprehensive of danger as they are incapable of avoiding it; and
as regardless of proper advice as they are ignorant of the reason for
it.</p>

<p>The time, I trust, is fast coming, when every female will be taught,
as of paramount importance, everything which concerns her own welfare;
and when ignorance will no longer be considered necessary to propriety
and virtue, nor useful knowledge incompatible with the most refined
delicacy and the strictest morality. I consider it my duty to assist
in hastening that time, and I feel much pleased that my previous
efforts have been so much commended. This book I hope will be equally
acceptable, and, if possible, more useful, than those which have
preceded it.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Parturition</span>, or the expulsion of the
perfectly formed human being from the body of its mother, is a most
wonderful natural function, for the complete and safe performance
of which at the proper time, every requisite is found to exist.
Notwithstanding the contrary experience of society, as it now exists,
it is well known that extreme suffering, and danger to life, are not
necessary nor even probable accompaniments to child-birth; for it is
invariably found, when females live under circumstances favourable to
their full physical development and health, that it occurs speedily,
and with little or no difficulty or pain. Numerous proofs of this could
be given in accounts of the Indians, and other uncivilized females,
among whom parturition is regarded as an ordinary occurrence, for which
no preparation need be made, and about which no apprehension need be
felt; such facts, however, are so well known that they only need be
referred to here.</p>

<p>As the organization and requirements of society changes, by the
adoption of what is called civilization, the condition of woman becomes
very different to what it was originally. In many respects her lot
is much meliorated, and she has great reason to be pleased with the
change, but in other respects she has not been so fortunate.</p>

<p>One great evil resulting from her altered position is, a neglect of
proper physical education while young, and of the various requirements
for bodily health in after life. In consequence of which she becomes
constitutionally weaker, and more sensitive to various injurious
influences, which she possesses diminished powers to withstand. This
evil increases in proportion as civilization advances, until at last
females become so imperfectly organized, and so enervated, that they
are utterly unable to fulfil the duties assigned them, and they either
die prematurely, or pass their whole lives in suffering and complaint.
So universally is this the case at the present time, particularly
in cities, that the exempt are very rare exceptions to a rule most
lamentably general. Unfortunately, custom and false notions have given
this melancholy state the stamp of propriety, and thrown around it the
charm of fashion. The suffering invalid is called <em>interesting</em>,
and the pale faced debilitated creature, scarcely able to crawl
about, is styled <em>genteel</em>, while robust health and physical
capability is termed <em>coarseness</em> and <em>vulgarity</em>. So
infatuated, and weak minded, have females been made on this point,
that I have actually known some of them quite chagrined because people
could see they were well and strong; and I have known others quite
alarmed for fear that they should <em>look</em> so. A short time ago
I knew a lady who, by the adoption of a proper course of training and
treatment, passed through her confinement so quickly, and with so
little exhaustion, that she was up and travelling about in three days
after, not only without inconvenience but with pleasure and advantage.
But what was the impression made on her female friends by such a
speedy recovery? did they feel quite pleased at it, and desirous that
all others should be equally fortunate? No; but quite the contrary!
She was actually thought deserving of <em>reprehension</em>, and
was stigmatized as <em>vulgar</em> in the extreme. One person even
made the remark, that she must be <em>a very common person</em>,
<em>and no Lady!</em> Now what a pitiable state of ignorance, and
mental imbecility, these females must be in, to be actually <em>proud
of their infirmities</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi"
id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> and yet they are but like the majority
of their sex. If they were not so <em>unfortunate</em> in not knowing
their true interests, they would be highly culpable, but as it is they
are truly deserving of our pity.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, that though civilization has, so far,
entailed these evils on women, it has also done much to alleviate
them. Many diseases are beneficially modified, and some are even
<em>cured</em>, by medical treatment; surgical science has also
attained a high point of perfection; and the difficulties attendant on
child birth are overcome to a great extent by obstetrical skill. But
notwithstanding all this alleviation, these evils are still deplorably
great. The utmost scientific skill to which society can ever attain,
will do but little towards effectually relieving human suffering,
and removing disease, so long as it is entirely devoted to the mere
art of <em>curing</em> and <em>palliating</em> as it chiefly is now.
Our knowledge of the human system, and of the causes which produce
in it disease and deterioration, must be universally disseminated,
so that the whole people may see <em>how these evils arise</em>, and
how they should live, and conduct themselves, so as to <em>avoid them
altogether!</em> or, in other words, science should teach us how to
<em>prevent</em> disease and suffering, instead of merely how to
alleviate them. Eventually this will be done, and our females will then
pass through their travail as easily as their savage sisters do now.
Let us hope that time will soon come; and let every one esteem it his
duty, who possesses the ability, to hasten its coming, by doing all he
can to spread the necessary information to those who need it.</p>

<p>The happy exemption from difficulty and suffering which females
enjoy in more uncultivated states of society, and which we believe
they will ultimately enjoy universally, does not however obviate the
necessity for assistance <em>now</em>, in our state of society, and we
have therefore to explain how it can best be rendered.</p>

<p>It has often been a matter of dispute, both with medical men and
with moralists, whether <em>Men</em> or <em>Women</em> ought to
assist in child-birth. The discussion has called forth a great deal
of declamation, but very little has been said to the point on either
side. It appears to me, however, that the question may be very easily
settled, if it be rightly considered. The first requisite, and the
most indispensable, in those who are to assist in child birth is, that
they should <em>know how to assist</em>. This is paramount to every
thing else. Now, if females really did know what to do in such cases,
and were fully competent to do it, I think there is no question but
they would be the <em>best</em> assistants, to say nothing of their
being the most <em>proper</em>. There are many things experienced by
females in such situations, which can never be understood by a man
at all, though they are readily appreciated by one of their own sex,
particularly if she has been a mother herself. With each other also
there would be less disposition and less occasion for reserve in
delicate communications, and less repugnance to necessary examination
or manipulation, which could therefore be more efficiently practised.
In short, if women were undoubtedly equally competent with men in
this art, and full confidence was felt in them by their own sex, I
think it is evident they would, in every respect, be the most fitting
practitioners, and I have no doubt but they would be preferred. The
question simply arises then, whether they are so competent? And every
one able to judge, who speaks honestly, must admit that very few, if
any of them really are so. It has not been possible for them to acquire
the requisite information, nor to pursue the necessary investigations,
and therefore we cannot expect that they can be equal to those who
have. There are some women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii"
id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> I know, who have been careful observers,
and who have had great experience, that can render all needful
help <em>in most cases</em>, but even they are apt to meet with
difficulties, which require more skill than they possess to overcome;
therefore very few like to depend upon them altogether. It is naturally
argued that, as a physician <em>may</em> be needed, it is better to
have him at first, and so be ready for every contingency.</p>

<p>That females can make competent <i lang="fr"
xml:lang="fr">Accoucheurs</i> is proved by numerous well known instances,
among which I need only refer to <span class="smcap">Madame
Boivin</span>, and <span class="smcap">Madame Lachapelle</span>, both
of whom, as practitioners and as authors, stand in the very highest
rank. These ladies are referred to as authorities, and their works are
quoted by the most eminent Professors of the day; in fact, on many
points, they have surpassed all competitors. Further on in our work we
shall have occasion to refer to their labours, the value of which will
then be seen.</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that females can officiate, if they are
properly instructed, which I think they ought to be, independent of the
reasons already given. That they will eventually be competent I have no
doubt, and I am proud to throw my mite of instruction in their way to
assist in making them so.</p>

<p>In regard to the alledged <em>immorality</em> resulting from the
present system of men acting as Midwives, there is much exaggeration,
and much unnecessary alarm. That it is, in some respects, indelicate,
and only to be justified by necessity is true, but there is no
foundation for saying, as some do, that it leads to wide spread
Profligacy and Adultery. I should prefer to see females always able
to assist each other; but I cannot nevertheless consider the present
system a necessary cause of licentiousness.</p>

<p>That females were always depended upon in old times, and are now
in certain rude communities, is true, but that is no reason why they
should be depended upon under all circumstances. In our present
highly artificial state there are numerous causes at work, and
numerous difficulties experienced, unknown to more primitive times and
conditions, and we therefore require greater skill and more extensive
resources. Females have in fact become more in want of help, and less
able to assist.</p>

<p>At what time, and in what country, men first began to assist
in cases of labour is not recorded. They have done so however for
a long time, much longer than most people suppose. In the time of
<i>Hippocrates</i>, called the Father of Medicine, who lived <em>more than
four hundred years before Christ</em>, it appears that physicians were
commonly resorted to. In his writings we find cases described, which
show that he was well acquainted with the process of parturition, and
even with some of the most difficult operations now practised. The
Israelites appear to have employed women, as most eastern nations in
fact do at the present day.</p>

<p>Midwifery, however, did not attract much attention, nor make much
progress, till about the middle of the sixteenth century, since when
it has been studied and practised by the most eminent Physicians and
Surgeons, and has arrived at great perfection.</p>

<p>Many new discoveries have been made lately, which enable us to
facilitate delivery and ease its pains, so that it is now robbed of
many of its former terrors and dangers. Some of these discoveries are
of easy application, and promise much future good; I shall carefully
describe them all, in the following pages.</p>

THE ORGANS AND PARTS OF THE FEMALE BODY CONCERNED IN GENERATION AND

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> understand the subjects treated
upon in the present work, it is necessary to have at least a general
acquaintance with the structure, position, and special uses of
the principal organs and parts of the female system. A complete
acquaintance, so far as our knowledge extends, would be advisable, but
is not absolutely required, and could not with convenience be given
here. The following explanations therefore, chiefly taken from my

<h5>INTERNAL ORGANS.</h5>

<p><i>The Ovaries.</i>&mdash;(<i>e. e.</i> Plates I, II and
III.)&mdash;These are two oval shaped bodies, about the size of an
almond nut, placed one on each side, nearly in the groin. They contain a
number of small round grains, or granules, called the <i lang="la"
xml:lang="la">ovæ</i>, or eggs, which are the germs of human beings, as
the eggs of birds are of their particular kind. They are connected with
the uterus by two short arms, or prolongations, and are enclosed in the
folds of the broad ligaments.</p>

<p><i>The Fallopian Tubes.</i>&mdash;(<i>f. f.</i> Plates I and
II.)&mdash;These are two Tubes, one on each side, beneath the Ovaries,
and extending farther. Each of them has a small passage which opens into
the uterus at one end, and opposite the Ovaries at the other. Their use
is to convey the impregnating principle to the Ovaries, at the time of
conception, and to convey the Ovæ, when impregnated, to the interior of
the Womb.</p>

<p><i>The Uterus, or Womb.</i>&mdash;(B. Plates I, II.)&mdash;This is a
hollow organ, placed between the Bladder, which is in front, and the
Rectum, which is behind. It is connected with the Vagina, and opens
into it by the small orifice called the mouth of the womb.&mdash;(<i>g.</i>
Plate I.)&mdash;The Uterus is the organ which receives the impregnated
ovum, and in which it is developed into the human being. It is
connected with the Ovaries by the Fallopian Tubes, and with the
Vagina by the Os Tincæ, and is retained in its situation partly by
its connections with other organs, and partly by the round and broad
ligaments.</p>

<p><i>The Vagina.</i>&mdash;(C. Plate I.)&mdash;This is the passage which
leads to the Womb from the external opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"
id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Os Tincæ, or Mouth of the Womb.</i>&mdash;(<i>g.</i> Plates I and
II.)&mdash;This is the small orifice, opening into the Vagina, by which
communication is established with the Uterus from without.</p>

<p><i>The Bladder.</i>&mdash;(A. Plates I and II.)&mdash;The Receptacle of
the Urine. It is placed immediately in front, on the pubic bone, the
Uterus lying nearly on the top of it.</p>

<p><i>The Rectum, or Termination of the large Intestine.</i> (D. Plates I
and II.)&mdash;This is situated behind the Vagina, and between it and
the back bone.</p>

<p><i>The Broad Ligaments.</i>&mdash;(<i>s.</i> Plate III.)&mdash;These
are two broad folds of membrane, which serve partly to enclose the
Fallopian Tubes and Ovaries, and partly to sustain the Womb in its place.
They adhere to the Uterus and to the walls of the Pelvis.</p>

<p><i>The Round Ligaments.</i>&mdash;(<i>r. r.</i> Plates II and III.) These two
cords arise from each upper corner of the Uterus, and curving downwards
are fixed by their other extremities to the pubic bone. They are partly
enclosed in the Broad Ligaments. They assist in sustaining the Uterus
in its position, and probably also they strengthen the Broad Ligaments
and prevent their rupture when the strain upon them is too great.</p>

<p><i>Fimbriæ of the Fallopian Tubes.</i>&mdash;(<i>t. t.</i> Plate III.) These
Fimbriæ are like Tentaculæ, or fingers, springing from the extreme ends
of the Tubes, and floating loosely in the cavity of the pelvis. Their
use is to clasp hold of the ovaries at the time of conception, so that
the fecundating principle can reach them, and also to take up the ovæ
when impregnated, and convey them into the Tube, down which they pass
into the Womb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h5>EXTERNAL ORGANS.</h5>

<p><i>The External Lips.</i>&mdash;(<i>l.</i> Plate I.)&mdash;These are
commonly termed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Labiæ externa</i>. They
are two broad folds of membranous and adipose substance, forming the
portals to the Vulva, or entrance to the Vagina.</p>

<p><i>The Internal Lips.</i>&mdash;(<i>m.</i> Plate I.)&mdash;These are two
smaller labiæ, sometimes called the Nymphæ, within the first, the chief
use of which appears to be to direct the flow of the urine from the
urethra.</p>

<p><i>The Hymen.</i>&mdash;(<i>n.</i> Plate I.)&mdash;This is a membrane
generally found in virgins, which grows over and closes more or less
completely the entrance to the Vagina. Use unknown. When it exists
there is generally a small orifice through it, by which the menses
escape at each monthly period.&mdash;(<i>o.</i> Plate I.)</p>

<p><i>The Clitoris.</i>&mdash;(<i>p.</i> Plate I.)&mdash;This is a small
prominent organ, about the size of a large pea, placed in the upper
part of the opening between the external lips, and immediately above
the Meatus Urinarius. It is the principal seat of venereal excitement,
and is subject to many annoying diseases.</p>

<p><i>The Perineum.</i>&mdash;(<i>q.</i> Plate I.)&mdash;The part between the
Vulva, or entrance to the Vagina, and the fundament. It is chiefly
composed of the muscles belonging to the neighboring parts, and assists
very much in supporting the womb.</p>

<p><i>The Meatus Urinarius</i>, or Mouth of the Bladder, (<i>h.</i> Plate
I.)&mdash;A small opening by which the urine escapes, placed between
the lips, and immediately above the Vulva, or entrance to the
Vagina.</p>

<p>These organs are all placed within, or in contact with, the lower
part of the Trunk, called the pelvis.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> They are all intimately
connected with each other, and some of them have most extensive and
strong sympathies with almost every other part of the system. So much
so is this the case in fact, that probably the great majority of
diseases to which females are liable arise, directly or indirectly,
from Uterine or Ovarian derangement. Very often the heart, the
stomach, or some other organ, though perfectly healthy, is thought to
be diseased, and appears to be so, merely from its sympathy with the
diseased womb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> addition to the general explanation
already given, there are some of the Female organs whose peculiar
structure requires to be more fully noticed, on account of its
important influence on some of the processes hereafter to be
described.</p>


<h5>THE WOMB.</h5>

<p>The external appearance of the womb, viewed in front, and in
connection with its appendages, is shown in Plate III. It is placed
in the Pelvis, between the bladder and the Rectum, and at the top of
the Vagina, as seen in Plates I and II. Its internal structure is
represented in Plate IV.</p>

<p>The length of the Womb, after puberty, is about three inches; its
breadth at the upper part, or fundus, about two inches; and at the
cervix, or neck, about one inch. The cavity in the interior is small,
owing to the thickness of the walls, and its form is triangular. The
shape of the Womb resembles a pear, somewhat flattened, from before
backward. Previous to puberty its size is much smaller, and with those
who have had children it often exceeds the dimensions we have given.</p>

<p>The <i>Neck</i>, or narrow part, (<i>c.</i> Plate IV.) is much changed by
pregnancy. In virgins it is long and pointed, and somewhat enlarged
in the middle. In those who have borne children it is considerably
shorter, more obtuse, and less regular in its form. The cavity in the
Neck is larger in the middle than at either end, as will be seen in
Plate IV.</p>

<p>The <i>Os Tincæ</i>, or mouth of the Womb, also undergoes considerable
change from the same cause. In the young person it is merely
like a small slit, scarcely to be felt, but after pregnancy
it much enlarges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> and remains more or less permanently open.
The anterior lip, or the one in front, is somewhat larger than the
posterior one.</p>

<p>The body of the Uterus is formed of a very dense, gray colored,
muscular substance, possessing astonishing contractile power. The
interior is lined, like the Vagina, with a mucus membrane, and
the whole organ is plentifully supplied with arteries, veins, and
nerves.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable properties of the Womb is that of being
able to distend to an extraordinary degree, and then retract again to
nearly its original size. The force which it sometimes exhibits during
its contraction is very great, being sufficient to separate, and even
break, the bones of the mother's pelvis, and paralyze the hand of the
operator when introduced. The Muscular Fibres on which this contractile
force depends are most obvious during gestation; they then appear
very numerous, and very curiously disposed, some of them ramifying in
almost every direction, as will be seen by Plates V, VI. It is owing to
this that the Womb contracts in every conceivable direction, and thus
presses, during labor, on every part of the child's body.</p>

</p>


<h5>THE VAGINA.</h5>

<p>The Vagina (<i>c.</i> Plate I.) is a membranous canal, lined with a mucus
membrane like the Uterus. By its upper part it is attached to the neck
of the Womb, at about two-thirds of its height&mdash;so that two-thirds
of the neck hang within the Vagina. Below, it terminates in the Vulva,
or external mouth. The upper part of the Vagina is much larger than
the lower part, particularly in those who have borne children. It is
capable of considerable distension, and after retraction, to allow of
the child passing down it from the Womb. The external mouth is called
the <em>Vulva</em>, and is usually partly closed, in the virgin state,
by the membrane called the Hymen, (<i>n.</i> Plate I.) The length of the
Vagina is from three to five inches, and its diameter from one inch
to one and a half, or even two inches in those who have borne many
children.</p>


<h5>THE VULVA.</h5>

<p>This is the external opening, or mouth of the Vagina, through which
the child has to pass at the termination of delivery. The external and
internal lips, with the muscular and membranous tissue surrounding it,
are all capable of great distension, without injury, to allow of the
passage of the child.</p>


<h5>THE PERINEUM.</h5>

<p>This is the part situated between the Vulva and the Rectum.
(<i>p.</i> Plate I.) It is composed of a somewhat dense and firm
substance, chiefly muscular, and, like all the other parts
mentioned, is capable of great distension. It is important, in
many of the manipulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> during labor, to be well acquainted
with it; and when the child's head is passing the perineum requires
supporting, to prevent its being lacerated or broken through, an
accident which often happens from want of due attention, and which
leads to the most serious consequences.</p>


<h5>THE PELVIS.</h5>

<p>The Pelvis is that part of the bony structure, or skeleton, of the
female, in which the generative organs are placed, and through which
the process of parturition is effected. An acquaintance with its
natural structure, and with the changes which may be produced in its
form and size, by disease and other accidents, is indispensable to
those who wish to practise or understand midwifery.</p>

<p>In early life the Pelvis is composed of several bones, many of
which, after puberty, grow together. In the adult female it is
customary to speak of but <em>four</em> bones, the sacrum, the
coccygis, and the two innominata, or hip bones, (see Plates <a
href="#Page_33">VII</a>, <a href="#Page_37">VIII</a>.) In the young
female these are divided into several distinct parts.</p>

</div>

<p>Section of the Pelvis, to show the shape and connection of those
parts not distinctly visible in the full view. The section is made down
the middle of the back bone, and through the symphysis pubes, in front.
The letters correspond with those in Plate VII.</p>

<p class="space-below">A. The right Ilium.&mdash;B. The
Sacrum.&mdash;C. The Coccygis.&mdash;<i>b.</i> The Os Pubis.&mdash;<i>c.</i>
The Os Ischinum.&mdash;<i>g.</i> The Foramen Magnum.&mdash;<i>o.</i> shows
the manner in which the coccygis is bent back through labor.</p>

<p>These bones are all firmly bound together by a cartilaginous
substance, which is placed between where they touch, and is firmly
attached to each one. This union is called a <em>symphysis</em>. The
one at front which joins the pubic bones is called the symphysis
pubis; the two which join the Ossa Illii to the Sacrum are called
the sacro iliac symphyses;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> and that which joins the Coccygis to the
Sacrum, is called the Sacro coccygeal symphysis. The two pubic bones
are separated a little in Plate VIII, simply to show them better. The
reader will bear in mind that they are naturally connected by the
cartilaginous substance which forms the symphysis.</p>

<p>These articulations, or joinings, become much softened during labor,
and give way a little, but not to any extent sufficient to assist
delivery. It is a mistake to suppose that the bones separate at that
time. The only part which gives way is the sacro coccygeal symphysis,
which does relax, and allows the Os Coccygis to be pushed back by
the child's head a full inch or more, thus enlarging the inferior
strait.&mdash;(See <i>c.</i> and <i>o.</i> Plate VIII.) Sometimes this little
bone will be even broken off, when there is great disproportion between
the head and the strait. I have heard it snap like a stick breaking.
There is nothing serious nor alarming in this, however, unless it be
<em>a first delivery late in life</em>, though it may cause some pain
at the time, and a little difficulty in <em>sitting</em> for some time
after. In young persons the symphysis is soft, and gives way easily,
so that they have little difficulty during delivery from this cause;
but if a female marry late in life, after it becomes hardened, she
may suffer considerably. In this case the coccygis is usually curved
inwards considerably, and being firmly fixed the head cannot push it
back, and on that account cannot pass, without great difficulty, and
with the risk of rupturing some of the soft parts, or breaking the
coccygis completely off. There is in fact great difficulty, and some
danger, if the first pregnancy takes place late in life.</p>

<p>The Pelvis is usually divided into two parts,&mdash;the
<em>great pelvis</em>, or upper part, enclosed between the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> wide
flanges of the Ossa illii and the upper part of the sacrum; and the
<em>small pelvis</em>, or basin, which is enclosed between the lower
part of the sacrum and coccygis behind, and the ossa ischii and ossa
pubes in front. The basin is nearly cylindrical, larger in the middle,
and curved towards the front.</p>

<p><i>The Straits of the Pelvis.</i>&mdash;The bones of the Pelvis, it will
be seen, form a kind of broad ring, or cylinder, particularly in the
basin; and the straits are two passages, one by which the child passes
into the basin from the upper Pelvis, and the other by which it passes
out from the basin into the world.</p>

<p>In Plate VIII. the line marked † is the antero posterior diameter of
the <em>upper strait</em>, through which the child first passes, called
also the brim, or entrance to the Pelvis. The line marked ‡ is the
diameter of the <em>lower</em> strait, through which the child passes
into the world, called also the outlet of the Pelvis. In Plate VII. the
line marked † crosses the upper strait, or brim of the Pelvis.</p>

<p><em>The diameters of the Pelvis</em> are the distances between the
prominent points of each strait, and are four in number for each,
<em>those for the upper</em> strait being represented below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"

<div class="plate-intro"><p class="center"><strong>PLATE IX.</strong></p>

<p class="center"><i>Diameters of the Upper Strait.</i></p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A B, which extends from the most prominent
point of the Sacrum, to the top of the Symphysis pubes, is called
the <em>antero posterior</em> diameter, or that from before
to behind.&mdash;C D, and E F, are called the two <em>oblique
diameters</em>; they extend from each sacro iliac symphysis, to the
most prominent point of the Os Ilium on the opposite side.&mdash;G H,
is called the Transverse, or <em>bis iliac</em> diameter, it crosses
the Pelvis nearly from one hip joint to the other.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The Sacro Antero posterior diameter
measures <em>four inches</em>. The two oblique diameters <em>four

<p>It will thus be seen that the diameters only average from four to
five inches, but it must be remembered that the soft parts, and even
one of the bones, very readily give way, and thus they are slightly
increased.</p>

<p>When we come to describe the form and size of the fœtal child's
head, it will be found that its diameters correspond very nearly
with those of the pelvic straits through which it has to pass, so
that ordinarily labor presents no serious difficulty. If the head be
larger than natural, from any cause, or if the Pelvis be too small,
or deformed, this mutual adaptation does not exist, and delivery of
course becomes difficult, or dangerous, and sometimes impossible. The
only obstacle therefore, which can seriously impede the expulsion of
the fœtus, or prevent it altogether, is this want of conformity, in
size and shape, between its head and the bones of the Pelvis. The
<em>soft parts</em> may retard labor considerably, by being contracted
or rigid, but can generally be made to give way, either by the efforts
of nature or by manual assistance; and the fœtal head can be reduced
in size if necessary; but insufficient size, or faulty form, in the
<em>bones</em>, is irremediable.</p>

<p>The various causes which produce deformity, or imperfect
development, in the Pelvis, and unnatural growth of the child's head,
will be stated in a subsequent section. For the present, we have only
to do with both in the normal state.</p>

<p>The importance of an accurate knowledge of the structure of the
Pelvis, and of the changes which may be induced in it, will now be
obvious; neither the theory nor the practice of Midwifery can in
fact be understood without such knowledge. It is also frequently of
the first importance to know, <em>previous<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> to marriage</em>, whether
the pelvis of a young person is so formed that delivery can be safely
effected! Inattention to this has sacrificed the lives of many, and
caused others to live for years suffering and helpless. In another
place we shall give some plain rules and directions by which this
important point may be determined.</p>

<p class="spaced"><i>The floor of the Pelvis.</i>&mdash;The soft parts
at the bottom of the basin of the Pelvis, consisting of the perineum
and various muscles, are called the floor of the Pelvis&mdash;the only
passage through which is by the Vulva, or mouth of the Vagina. As the
head of the child descends to the bottom of the basin, it presses upon
this floor, and gradually distends it, until the Vulva is sufficiently
enlarged. This delay is advantageous, for if the passage was always
large enough, or increased in size without any difficulty, the child
would pass too suddenly, and much mischief might often result from its
sudden expulsion&mdash;such as pulling down of the womb, flooding, and
the falling of the child upon the ground.</p>

<p class="spaced"><i>Direction of the passage of the
Pelvis.</i>&mdash;In most of the lower animals the passage of the Pelvis
is straight, and on a line with the body, the two straits being
opposite each other, which makes delivery much more easy with them.
Even in the negroes, and other inferior races, the passage is much
straighter than in the whites. The more perfect the organization
therefore, the more difficult is parturition; and the more imperfect or
simple the organization, the more easy is parturition. The dotted line
in Plate XI. shows the direction of the passage of the Pelvis, in the
human female, to be a curve, so that the child has to move, during its
passage, in a circle.</p>

<em>each</em> direction, it has to traverse a path intermediate with
them all, or compounded of them all, not being able to move in either
alone. This aggregate direction is denoted by the dotted curved line,
which shows the direction in which the child passes, and in which the
hand must be passed when introduced.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>FUNCTIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL FEMALE ORGANS.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great object for which the whole
of the Female organs perform their several functions is, <em>that of
bringing into existence a new being!</em> For this purpose they act
both separately and conjointly, each one having its specific part to
play in the grand phenomenon. As already remarked, it would not be in
place here to give all the details of this wonderful event, but merely
such a description of its principal stages, as will suffice for an
understanding of the main subject of the present treatise. I shall
therefore, first give the uses of the principal organs separately, and
then explain the processes of conception, and fœtal development.</p>


<h5>THE WOMB.</h5>

<p>The Womb is nothing more than the receptacle in which the
impregnated egg is placed, and in which it undergoes all the wonderful
changes by which it eventually is developed into a perfect human being.
The womb is not therefore absolutely needed in <em>conception</em>, and
indeed several cases have been known where the new being was formed
without the womb altogether, though not perfectly. Its principal use is
in fœtal development, which cannot take place perfectly in any other
part of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51"
id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h5>THE OVARIES.</h5>

<p>The Ovaries, as already remarked, are two oval-shaped bodies, placed
one on each side of the womb, and connected with it, whose use is to
form the germ or rudiment, called the ovum, or egg, from which the new
being is developed. The structure of the Ovaries is very simple, and
the manner in which they produce the ovum is not very well understood.
It is certain however, that they are indispensable to conception, being
in fact the most essential parts of the female generative system.</p>


<h5>MENSTRUATION.</h5>

<p>Menstruation appears to be a process resulting from the development
and healthy action of the Female organs, and is essential to their
well being. The following brief account of its nature and origin is
extracted from my <cite>Diseases of Woman</cite>, page 152 to 155:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Until very recently but little was known, with any certainty,
respecting this remarkable and important phenomenon of the female
system. The most crude and visionary theories have been advanced to
explain it, and our works on medicine and physiology do nothing more
than repeat them, one after the other. The investigations of several
distinguished physiologists however, within the last few years, have
thrown a new light on this hitherto obscure subject, and explained much
that was previously unknown, or, at best, merely conjectured upon. A
brief statement of the result of those investigations will not only be
highly interesting in itself, but will materially assist in explaining
what we shall afterwards speak upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is well known that the female organs are liable, at regular
periods, to assume a peculiar action, which results in the discharge
of a fluid termed the menses. The secretion and excretion of which
are highly essential, both to the proper performance of many other
functions, and to the maintenance of the general health. Whence
comes this fluid, and what causes it to flow? These were questions
unanswered, except by mere supposition, previous to the discoveries
referred to, which we now proceed to make known.</p>

<p>"In the first chapter it was stated that the <i lang="la"
xml:lang="la">Ovæ</i>, or eggs, contained the rudiments or germs, from
which, when impregnated by the male principle, new human beings were
developed. These ovæ, however, are not prepared to undergo this
development before the age of puberty, nor after the change of life,
nor are the whole of them fit for conception even during the prolific
period. It appears that they become fit for fecundation in succession,
during the menstrual period, <em>one ovum,</em> or more, <em>being
ripened every month!</em> When fully perfected it separates from the
ovary and is lost, unless conception occurs, in which case it passes
along the fallopian tube into the Womb, and then develops into the
fœtus. Here then we see the cause of the menses; the ripening of the
ovum causes a local excitement, and congestion, in the ovary and womb,
which increases till the period when it is thrown off, and then the
accumulated fluid is discharged, the excitement subsides, and a new
development commences.</p>

<p>"This curious process is termed by some physiologists the monthly
<em>ponte</em>, or <em>laying of eggs</em>, and by others the
<em>Ovarian labor</em>, or <em>birth!</em> A small scar is left on the
ovary at the point where the ovum separates,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> which fades away after a
time, but a number of them may always be observed on the ovaries of
those who have long menstruated. In those who die during menstruation
the ovaries are found very red, and full of blood, and sometimes one of
the ovæ will be found swelled, and just ready to burst through, or the
ruptured opening may be seen through which it has actually escaped.</p>

<p>"Precisely the same phenomenon occurs in the lower animals,
excepting that their periods are more extended; some of them occurring
annually, and others at still longer intervals. Some of the monkeys
even have a species of real menstruation.</p>

<p>"These important facts, by enabling us to understand what causes
menstruation, give us an insight also into the nature of its
derangements, and the conditions required for their regulation. When
we call to mind also the close sympathy between the uterine organs and
every other part of the system, it shows us how important a proper
menstruation is to the general health, because without it those organs
must be diseased, and consequently every other part of the system
liable to suffer with them.</p>

<p>"Formerly many absurd notions prevailed respecting menstruation,
which in fact are not quite removed even now. Thus some authors
asserted that a female, while unwell, could cause various diseases,
by merely <em>touching</em> persons! Others supposed they would
curdle milk, and nearly all believed that the menstrual fluid
itself was highly poisonous, so that females, at those times, were
compelled to live apart and approach no one. In the Old Testament
there are many regulations given, for females while menstruating,
which show the prevalence of such notions in olden times. It is
scarcely necessary to say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> there is no foundation whatever for all
this, as the fluid itself differs but little from ordinary blood, and
is equally innocuous.</p>

<p>"In like manner it was supposed, that menstruation was influenced by
the <em>Moon</em>, and only occurred at a certain period of her age. We
know, however, that females are unwell almost every hour of every day
in the year.</p>

<p>"The due establishment of the menstrual function is absolutely
necessary, to the perfection both of mind and body, and its regular
performance is quite as essential to the continuance of health, for
there is scarcely a single disease that its derangement will not either
cause, or at least seriously aggravate.</p>

<p>"It is therefore <em>vitally important</em> to attend to this
matter, <em>particularly in young persons approaching puberty!</em>
A little care at that time, properly bestowed, may prevent years of
disease and suffering, if not untimely <em>death!</em>"</p>

</div>


<h5>CONCEPTION.</h5>

<p>Conception is the union of the male principle with the female ovum,
or egg, after that is perfected in the manner described in the article
on Menstruation. The precise manner in which this union is effected is
unknown, though our information in regard to it is much more extensive,
and precise, than formerly. As nearly as can be stated it occurs in the
following way:</p>

<p>At the time of a fruitful connection, which can only occur, it must
be remembered, when the ovum is ripe, the male principle is carried
into the Womb, (B, Plates I. and III.) and is then supposed, by some,
to meet with the ovum which has descended down<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> the Fallopian Tube (<i>f</i>,
Plates I. and III.) from the Ovary, so that the union of the two takes
place, according to this view, either in the Fallopian Tube or in
the Womb. Others, however, suppose that the ovum does not leave the
Ovary before conception, but that the male principle passes down the
Fallopian Tube and meets it there, and that it is several days after
before it reaches the Womb. There are many facts and arguments brought
forward in support of each view, all of which will be set forth in my
forthcoming work on the reproductive functions. All that is known for
certain is, that the two principles must unite in one place or the
other, and that the ovum must pass down the Tube into the Womb, either
before impregnation, or after.</p>

<p>The union of the two principles in the Womb appears so likely an
event that it is scarcely possible to avoid thinking that it really
does then take place, but at the same time there are very strong
reasons for adopting the opinion that it takes place in the Ovary.
Among others may be mentioned the phenomenon of <em>extra uterine
conception</em>, which will be more fully alluded to in another place.
In these cases the fœtus is found <em>outside</em> of the Womb, in the
Tube, or the Ovary, or even in the Abdomen, among the intestines. Such
an occurrence seems to render it almost certain that the ovum must
have been fecundated in the Ovary, because we cannot well conceive,
if it were not so, how it could reach the outside of the Womb. This
difficulty is not, however, regarded as insuperable, by the advocates
of the opposite theory. Possibly conception may occur <em>in both
ways</em>.</p>

<p>There are many causes which prevent conception, or, in other
words, which produce <em>barrenness</em> and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> <em>sterility</em>.
These various causes cannot be all explained, except in connection
with a full explanation of the process of reproduction, and of the
nature of many female diseases. In my work on "<cite>The Diseases of
Woman</cite>," I have given a chapter on this subject, and have also
referred to the present work as one in which it would be more fully
treated. This reference, however, was made in mistake; the subject is
not needed here, but will be in the other work, on the <em>reproductive
functions</em> in which it will be discussed at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57"

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p class="ph3">FŒTAL DEVELOPMENT.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last Chapter brought us up to the
point of conception, or the first commencement of the new being. The
next step is to exhibit its various stages of development, and to
show how it is nourished and maintained in its proper position. This
is requisite in order to understand the origin of many diseases and
accidents which occur during gestation, and also to explain the various
signs by which it is determined whether a female is pregnant or not.</p>


<h5>FŒTAL DEVELOPMENT.</h5>

<p>The development of a perfectly formed human being from the egg in
which it originates, is one of the most astonishing phenomena that can
come under our observation, and is eminently deserving the study of
every rational being. The present explanation of it must necessarily be
brief, being merely intended to make the main subject more clear.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked that it is uncertain whether the ovum
is impregnated before it is brought into the Uterus, or after it
arrives there; but be that as it may, nothing has yet been discovered
in the Womb till several days after conception. Some physiologists tell
us that the rudiment of the new being may be found there about the
<em>sixth</em> day; but others again assure us that it cannot be found
before the <em>twelfth</em>, at which period our explanation of its
development will commence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><em>At the twelfth day</em> the ovum is about the size of a large
pea, it is composed of a vesicle containing a thick fluid, called
the <em>germ</em>, which corresponds to the opaque substance seen in
the white of a fecundated bird's egg, and of a yellowish substance,
in which it floats, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitellus</i>,
which answers to the yelk. The whole being surrounded by two membranous
coverings, the outer one called the <em>chorion</em>, and the inner
one the <em>amnion</em>. Between these is a gelatinous substance,
and within the amnion is a fluid, called the liquor amnii. The two
membranes, the liquor amnii, and the inclosed ovum, are called the
<em>ovulum!</em> Immediately after conception the uterus begins to
secrete, from its inner walls, another membrane, very delicate, called
the <em>decidua</em>. This lines the whole cavity, so that when the
ovulum passes out of the tube it is met by this lining which seems
to prevent its entrance into the womb. The ovulum, however, presses
upon it and so makes a depression, like a nest, in which it lies. This
prevents its moving about, or falling to the bottom of the womb.</p>

<p>The weight of the entire ovulum is about one grain. The embryo
commences in the germ, and may now be seen about the size of a pin's
point. The vitellus removes away from it, but remains connected by a
small pedicel or thread-like tube, down which it is gradually absorbed
as nutriment. A small white thread, scarcely perceptible, may be seen
sometimes as early as this period, being the commencement of the brain
and spinal marrow. The mouth is visible also from the twelfth to the
twentieth day, and frequently the eyes. These are placed at first on
the side of the head, like those of quadrupeds, and move round to the
front afterwards.</p>

<p><em>At twenty-five days</em>, the embryo is about the size<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> of a
large ant, which it also resembles in form. It begins to have a little
more consistence, and the future bones begin to resemble cartilage,
or gristle. A small groove may be seen denoting the neck, which thus
indicates the separation of the head from the trunk. The weight is
three or four grains.</p>

<p><i>The first month</i>, it is about the size of a Bee, and is somewhat
like a small worm bent together. The arms may be seen like two little
warts. They are first formed under the skin, and shoot out like buds,
growing straight from the body; afterwards they become folded together,
in a curious manner, upon the breast. The head is as large as the rest
of the body, and upon it we can now see distinctly the eyes, like
two black dots, the mouth, like a line, and also the nose. The lower
extremity is lengthened out like a tail. Weight about ten grains.</p>

<p><i>The second month.</i> Every part has now become much more developed,
and the general form is that of a human being. The superior members are
much more elongated, and the inferior ones begin to be distinguished,
forming in the same manner as the others. The fingers are united
together by a membrane, like the web on a Frog's foot. In the ribs,
clavicles, and jaw bones, a few points can be seen ossified, the
cartilage beginning; to harden into bone. The rudiments of the first
teeth are also visible. The weight is about one drachm, and the length
one inch.</p>

<p><i>At about seventy days</i> the eyelids are visible, the nose becomes
prominent, the mouth enlarges, and the external ear may be seen. The
neck is well defined. The brain is soft and pulpy, and the heart is
perfectly developed.</p>

<p>Every organ is originally formed without either blood or blood
vessels. The circulation which afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> takes place in them is
merely for their subsequent development. The heart is perfect in all
its parts, and even has a slight motion, before the blood is found in
it.</p>

<p><i>Three months.</i> All the essential parts are well defined. The
eyelids distinct, but firmly closed. The lips perfect, but drawn
tightly together. The heart beats forcibly, and in the larger vessels
red blood is seen. The fingers and toes are defined, and the muscles
begin to be apparent. The organs of generation are remarkably
prominent, but still it is somewhat difficult, at first, to distinguish
the sex by these organs, notwithstanding their development, as the
principal parts in both are nearly identical in form. It can, however,
be ascertained by other circumstances, as the form of the head, dorsal
spine, thorax, and abdomen. It now weighs about two ounces and a half,
and measures four or five inches in length.</p>

<p><i>Four months.</i> The development is remarkably increased. The brain
and spinal marrow becomes firmer, the muscles distinct, and a little
cellular tissue is formed. The abdomen is fully covered in and the
intestines are no longer visible. A little of the substance called
<em>meconium</em> even collects in the intestines, the same as is found
in at birth. It now weighs seven or eight ounces, and measures six or
seven inches. The bones are ossified in a great part of their extent,
and the rudiments of the second set of teeth are visible, under the
first.</p>

<p>The uterus now is so large that it can no longer remain in the
lower part of the pelvis, but is compelled to rise up into the
abdomen for more room. This change of position is improperly called
<em>quickening!</em> Sometimes it takes place very gradually, so<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> that it
is scarcely noticed, but more frequently it rises suddenly, disturbing
all the internal organs, and causing in them considerable derangement
till they accommodate themselves to the change. This occurrence often
causes unnecessary alarm, though the sickness, and other unpleasant
sensations, are always sufficiently annoying.</p>

<p>This stage corresponds with that in which the young of oviparous
animals breaks the shell and escapes. The human being however,
undergoes a remarkable change, and remains in the womb for a period
longer than that already past, in order to become more perfected.</p>

<p>From four to nine months the development is proportionally much more
rapid than during the first four months, owing to the circulation of
perfect red blood, which is now found the same as in the adult, and is
probably derived from the mother's blood vessels.</p>

<p><i>Five months.</i> Every part is considerably increased in size, and
become more perfect. The lungs enlarge, and are even capable of being,
to a certain extent, dilated. The skin becomes much stronger. The
situation of the nails can be discerned. The meconium is more abundant,
and lower down in the intestines. The length is now eight or ten
inches, and the weight fifteen or sixteen ounces.</p>

<p><i>Six months.</i> The nails are marked. The head becomes downy, from the
first development of the hair. A little fat is formed. Length twelve
inches, weight from one and a half to two pounds. No indications of
intellectual faculties.</p>

<p><i>Seven months.</i> The whole being has rapidly progressed. The
nails are formed, the hair is perfect, in the male the testicles
descend to the scrotum, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> in the female the ovaries reach the brim
of the pelvis. The bones are tolerably firm, and the meconium collects
in the large intestines. Length fourteen inches, weight about three
pounds. Intellectual functions not yet exercised.</p>

<p>The two remaining months are merely devoted to further increase in
size and weight. No new phenomena present themselves.</p>

<p><i>Nine months.</i> Every function has become active. The skin becomes
colored, and perspiration occurs. There are no indications of the
intellectual functions, but the animal functions are remarkably active,
particularly that of <em>taste</em>, which no doubt leads to the act of
sucking, from the natural desire for its gratification. The child can
now experience all the ordinary sensations of pain, hunger, heat, and
cold, and is capable of preserving an independent existence if brought
into the world.</p>

<h5>FŒTAL NUTRITION.</h5>

<p>The manner in which the new being derives its nutriment, or the
material by which it grows, is, in a great measure, unknown to us,
though we certainly obtain some little information about it by a study
of the apparatus employed in the process.</p>

<p>For the first fifteen or twenty days the substance called the
<em>Vitellus</em>, (<i>e.</i> Plate XII.) which is analagous to the yelk of
the ordinary egg, appears to supply most, if not all of the material
that is required in the formation of the new being; and indeed this
substance does not totally disappear till after the third month, though
we cannot suppose it to be the sole source of nutriment then. It is
also supposed, by some, that the amniotic liquor, in which the fœtus
floats, may afford some nutriment, either by being swallowed, or by
being absorbed through the skin. It is certain that this fluid is
nutritive, and there is nothing impossible in its absorption, though it
is not very likely to occur to a sufficient extent. The idea that it
can be swallowed however, is erroneous, because the mouth of the Fœtus
is firmly closed while in the Womb; and besides, children have been
born alive without <em>mouths</em>, and even without <em>heads</em>,
and of course they could not have swallowed anything. It is now
generally conceded by physiologists that the material required by the
Fœtus, for its nutrition, is obtained from the blood of the mother,
through the medium of the Placenta, and the vessels in the Umbilical
cord. It is, however, a matter of dispute whether the maternal blood
is sent directly, in its ordinary state, into the body of the child,
or whether it first undergoes a preparatory process, which most modern
authors suppose it does.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>From the earliest period of gestation, the middle membrane, called
the chorion, (<i>g. g.</i> P. XII.) is covered, on its outer surface, with
a number of small protuberances called <em>villosities</em>, which
subsequently become true blood vessels. About the fourth month these
have increased very much in size and number, and have all become
conglomerated into one mass, in form like a mushroom. This is called
the <em>Placenta</em>. It is almost entirely formed of blood vessels,
which seem to attach themselves at one end, by open mouths, to the open
mouths of other blood vessels on the inner walls of the uterus (<i>i.
i.</i> Plate XII.) At the other end these vessels are drawn together and
lengthened out into a long tube, called the <em>umbilical cord</em>,
or <em>navel string</em>, which finally enters the body of the child
at the navel and so establishes the connexion between it and the
mother.&mdash;(<i>c.</i> Plate XII.)</p>

<p>The blood vessels in the placenta, umbilicus, and fœtus, like
those in the maternal body, are of two kinds, <em>Arteries</em> and
<em>veins</em>. The arteries, which come from the <em>left</em> side
of the heart, carry the pure blood, which contains all the materials
for forming and nourishing every part of the system. The veins contain
the blood in its impure state, and take it to the <em>right</em> side
of the heart, from whence it is forced into the lungs to be purified
by the act of breathing. The blood is made impure by some of its
constituents being absorbed, to form the different parts of the body,
and by having thrown into it a quantity of waste and poisonous matter
no longer needed.</p>

<p>The course of the blood, therefore, is from the left side of
the mother's heart along her arteries till it reaches the arteries
of the uterus, from them it passes into those of the placenta,
and thence into those of the umbilicus which convey it into
the body of the child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69"
id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> When there it circulates in its arteries,
supplies the material for its further increase and development, becomes
in consequence impure, and passes into its veins, the same as in the
maternal body. From these veins it passes into those of the umbilicus
and placenta, and, apparently, into those of the mother, by which it
is conveyed to the right side of her heart, and by its action to her
lungs, to be again purified when she breathes. This explains what was
previously stated, that the child uses the mother's heart, lungs, and
stomach, while in the womb, and has, therefore, no occasion to use its
own.</p>

<p>The diameter of the placenta is about six inches, and its thickness
about one inch and a half. The length of the umbilical cord is from
eighteen to twenty-four inches, its diameter about half an inch. These
dimensions are, however, subject to great variation. Instances are
mentioned of the cord being five feet long, and as thick as the child's
arm. I have seen one myself four feet long. Sometimes it will be very
short, not more than eight or ten inches. It is composed of one artery
and two veins, twisted together like the strands of a cable, and of a
sheath surrounding them composed of the chorion and amnion. Between the
sheath and the vessels is a thick gelatinous fluid called the Gelatine
of Wharton.</p>

<p>This explanation, it must be remembered, is in fact merely
hypothetical. The direct passage of the blood through the Placenta,
from the mother's vessels into those of the cord, is denied by many
physiologists, who contend that there is an intermediate set of vessels
in the Placenta, in which it first undergoes important changes.
They also contend that the impure blood does not pass through into
the mother's veins at all, but is purified in the Placenta,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> and
immediately returned. Some have even averred that the Placenta is not
required at all, to supply nourishment, but is merely a purifying
organ. It is now known, however, that it is not absolutely essential
to either process, for children have been born alive, and perfectly
formed, which merely floated loosely in the amniotic liquor, having
neither Placenta nor cord, nor any other connection with the mother.
How they were nourished we cannot tell. These, however, must be
regarded merely as curious exceptions, there being little doubt but
that fœtal nutrition is ordinarily effected through the Placenta and
cord, by means of the mother's blood, somewhat in the manner we have
described.</p>


<h5>PECULIARITIES OF THE FŒTAL CIRCULATION.</h5>

<p>From the circumstance of the fœtus not using its heart and lungs,
like the adult, its circulation has several modifications.</p>

<p>The engine by which the blood is forced along its vessels is the
<em>heart!</em> This is divided into two distinct parts, each of which
has two cavities, the upper one called the <em>auricle</em>, and the
lower one the <em>ventricle</em>, which communicate with each other
by curious valves. In the adult the whole of the impure blood is
poured into the right auricle, that from the lower part of the body
by the <em>inferior vena cava</em>, and that from the upper part by
the <em>superior vena cava</em>. From the right auricle it passes
into the right ventricle, which pumps it into the lungs, by way of
the pulmonary artery; here it is purified by the act of respiration,
and then brought, when pure, by the pulmonary veins, into the left
auricle, and passes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> thence into the left ventricle, which
pumps it into the great aorta, and from thence into the smaller
arteries all over the body. The two sides of the heart, therefore,
do not communicate directly with each other, but there is a strong
partition between them. In the fœtus the arterial blood from the
mother, when it leaves the umbilical artery, enters first the liver,
runs through its vessels, gives off the bile found in it, and then
joins the vena cava inferior. By this passage it is taken into the
right auricle, along with the impure blood of the vena cava. From the
right auricle it passes through a hole in the partition directly into
the left auricle, instead of taking the indirect route by the lungs as
in the adult. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle,
and is from thence distributed by the arteries all over the body. This
opening in the partition is called the <em>foramen ovale!</em></p>

<p>After birth, when the blood begins to pass through the lungs, this
passage closes up. By the eighth day it is generally obliterated, often
much sooner, though occasionally it has remained open longer without
inconvenience. In some cases the foramen ovale does not close at all.
The child then has what is called the <em>blue disease!</em> The whole
body is of a uniform leaden, or blue color, and the whole system is
generally languid and sluggish. The blue color is caused by the dark
blood of the veins mixing with that of the arteries. These children
mostly die early, but some live to be five or six years old, and one I
saw twelve, but this is rare. No remedy can be had for this affliction,
and I have never known it to cure spontaneously. Some children are so
very dark for a few days after birth as to cause great alarm. This is
owing to the foramen ovale being very open and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> closing slowly. No
apprehension need be experienced in such cases, as it soon subsides.</p>

<p>The impure blood from the upper part of the fœtal body, which is
brought down by the superior vena cava, also enters the right auricle,
but does not pass from thence through the foramen, like that from the
inferior vena cava. By a peculiar arrangement this blood is made to
pass down into the right ventricle, and from thence along the pulmonary
artery, the same as in the adult state. Only a very small portion,
however, passes into the lungs, the great part being taken along a tube
called the <em>ductus arteriosus</em> into the great artery called the
aorta, where it begins to turn down to the lower part of the body. In
consequence of this, the arterial blood going down to the lower part of
the body, is mixed with this portion of impure, venous blood, brought
by the ductus arteriosus from the superior vena cava; while that going
to the head, and upper part of the body remains pure. And this is the
reason why the lower part is always so much smaller than the upper
part, previous to birth; it receives less pure nourishment. The head
and chest appear, at an early period, almost as large as the rest of
the body.</p>

<p>This circumstance also explains why, in the great majority of
cases, the <em>right</em> arm is preferred to the <em>left</em>, and
has more real power. The place where the ductus arteriosus pours the
impure blood into the aorta, is almost immediately opposite to where
the artery is given off which feeds the left arm. In consequence of
which, in most cases, a small portion of this impure blood becomes
mixed with the arterial blood, and the left arm is, therefore, in the
same situation as the lower limbs, and like them is comparatively
imperfectly developed. The right arm is<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> not liable to any such
deprivation. In some cases the insertion of the ductus arteriosus is
lower down, so that no such mixture occurs. Both arms are then equal,
and this accounts for the fact that in some persons there appears to
be no difference. In some cases, no doubt, early habit, or imitation,
may overcome this natural inferiority, and even give the preference
to the left arm; but such instances are rare; the general rule is the
contrary, and for the reason stated.</p>

<p>The ductus arteriosus closes up about the same time as the foramen
ovale.</p>

<p>The two veins which convey the impure blood back to the mother, to
be purified, originate from the iliac artery, in the pelvis. They pass
up the sides of the bladder towards the navel, enter the sheath of the
cord, and so reach the placenta. These vessels are obliterated about
the third or fourth day after birth, and remain afterwards in the form
of a fibrous cord.</p>

<p>The real source of <em>all</em> the blood in the body of the
child is a mystery; it would certainly appear most likely for the
whole of it to be derived from the mother's vessels, but there are
many circumstances which make it probable that the child may form
some itself, by digesting the fluid it is supposed to absorb. This
view is supported by the fact that there is found in its bowels at
birth, and even before, a greenish substance like excrement, called
<em>Meconium</em>. This has every appearance of being the product of
digestion, though some suppose it to be derived from the liver. It
occasionally contains hair, and other anomalous substances.</p>

<h5>THE BREAST.</h5>


<p>The Breasts, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mammæ</i>, are not needed in
the process of generation, nor are they absolutely necessary even after
birth; but as they are naturally associated, in the majority of cases,
with infantile nutrition, and are besides liable to many derangements
and diseases during pregnancy and child-birth, it is advisable to give
some account of them.</p>

<p>When one of the breasts is dissected it is found to be composed
chiefly of a singular body called the <em>Mammary Gland</em>, which
resembles somewhat a very firm piece of fat, of a yellowish drab
color. In the substance of this Gland are an immense number of little
cells, or vessels, in which, by some unexplainable process, the milk
is secreted, or made from the blood. From these little vessels there
proceeds small tubes which gradually unite into larger ones, and these
again into larger ones still, until at last all the milk is poured into
a few tubes, or canals, which terminate in the nipple. The outer mouths
of these terminal canals are only slightly contracted together, so that
the suction of the child's mouth, or even the pressure of the milk,
when the breast is full, will force them open and allow the fluid to
flow out.</p>

<p>The following plate represents the structure of the Breast, and
explains, as far as it can be explained, the manner in which it
performs its functions.</p>

<p>Sometimes there has been seen two and even three nipples on one
breast, and in a few cases one of the breasts has had no nipple at all.
The two glands are not immediately connected, but have a very intimate
sympathy with each other. The size of the breast depends more upon the
thickness of the layer of fatty substance, than upon the development
of the gland, so that one female, with a very full bosom, may have
but little milk, while another, whose breast is but little prominent,
may have a superabundance. The graceful swell of the fully developed
breast is, however, a matter of positive utility, as well as of beauty,
because it better adapts it to the use of the child, and probably also
adds to its <em>pleasure</em>, as any one may readily conceive who will
observe the delight with which an infant, even when not nursing, will
often caress it. Sir Astley Cooper says, "The natural obliquity of the
Mamella, or nipple, forwards and outwards, with a slight turn of the
nipple upwards, is one of the most beautiful provisions in nature, both
for the mother and the child. To the mother, because the child rests
upon her arm and lap in the most convenient position for sucking; for
if the nipple and breast had projected directly forwards, the child
must have been supported before her, in the mother's hands, in a most
inconvenient and fatiguing position, instead of it reclining upon her
side and arm. But it is wisely provided by nature, that when the child
reposes upon its mother's arm it has its mouth directly applied to the
nipple, which is turned outwards to receive it, whilst the lower part
of the breast forms a <em>cushion</em>, upon which the cheek of the
infant tranquilly reposes."</p>

<p>With the exception of the dark <em>areola</em>, or circle, and the
little tubercles around the nipple, the breast<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> is of the most delicate
structure and color, so that it blushes, or reddens, like the cheek,
from any sudden emotion, and goes pale during fainting.</p>

<p>As a general rule no milk is secreted in those who have not
become pregnant, nor in those who have passed the turn of life, but
occasionally exceptions are observed to this rule.</p>

<p>Bandelocque tells us of a girl only <em>eight</em> years of age,
who suckled her little brother more than a month! And Sir Hans Sloane
tells us of a lady aged <em>sixty eight</em>, who nursed several of her
grandchildren, though she had had no child herself for twenty years!
Dr. Francis, of New York, describes the case of a lady who continued to
secrete milk regularly for <em>fourteen years</em> after having lost
her child, so that she could always nurse an infant; and Dr. Kennedy
relates an instance of another who continued to suckle children,
uninterruptedly, for <em>forty-seven years</em>, and who had milk
perfectly sweet and good even when <em>eighty-one years old!</em> Dr.
Clark, of Alabama, informs us that a married lady, who had never been
pregnant, was requested to take charge of an infant during the night,
and that to quiet it she had put her nipple in its mouth. This was done
frequently, and to the great surprise of all it induced a flow of milk.
A singular circumstance connected with this was that the lady soon
after became <em>pregnant</em>, though previously barren! This will not
appear so surprising, however, to those who know the connection between
the breasts and the womb, and who have observed the mysterious bond of
sympathy by which their functions are united.&mdash;(See the articles
on <em>Menstruation</em>, and on <em>Sterility</em>, in my "Diseases of
Woman," for other instances of this kind.)</p>

<p>The structure of the male breast is precisely the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> same as
that of the female, but it is seldom developed. Instances have been
known, however, of the milk being secreted in men, and of children
having been nourished by it! Humboldt gives us an instance of this
kind, and Professor Hull, of Maryland, exhibited a colored man to his
class, in the year 1827, who had a large full bosom, like a female, and
who had often officiated as <em>wet nurse</em> in the family of his
mistress. The secretion appears to have been established by his putting
the children that he had to nurse to the nipple, to quiet them. When
the milk was not needed it was found as difficult to dry it up as it
is in some females, but it was soon made to flow again, by applying a
child to the breast for a few times. This man differed <em>in no other
respect</em> from any other man!</p>

<p>In the females of some races of the human kind, the mammæ attain
a surprising length, and become very flaccid, so that they hang down
to the hips, or lower, and may be thrown over the shoulder for the
child to nurse from while carried on the back. Some suppose this to
constitute a real variety of the human race, but others suppose it to
result merely from habit, which is probably correct.</p>

<p>When the breasts are small sized in young females, their growth may
often be promoted, but the means need not be pointed out here.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class="center">SIGNS OF PREGNANCY, AND THE MEANS OF DETECTING IT;
ITS DURATION, AND THE PERIOD AT WHICH THE FŒTUS CAN LIVE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is always desirable, and frequently of
the first importance, to be able to know whether a female is pregnant
or not, both to the accoucheur and to the individual, or even to be
able to judge whether she is probably or possibly so, or not. Sometimes
this can be decided positively, but more frequently it is a matter
of great uncertainty. The presumptive and positive signs on which a
judgment can be formed are of various kinds, most of which can be
readily observed, and easily made use of by any person in possession of
the information already given in the preceding section. They will be
set forth in the following Chapters, together with such other matter as
appertains to this part of the subject, in such a manner as will make

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"

<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<p class="center">SIGNS OF PREGNANCY, AND THE MEANS OF DETECTING IT.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> signs of Pregnancy are of three
kinds&mdash;Presumptive, Probable, and Certain.</p>


<h5>PRESUMPTIVE SIGNS.</h5>

<p>The presumptive signs of pregnancy are only of value in the first
<em>three months</em>. They consist mainly of certain nervous and
organic derangements, and of certain changes in personal appearance. It
is scarcely possible to enumerate all these, nor is it necessary; we
shall therefore only specify those most important, and most generally
met with.</p>

<p>Colic pains, and creeping of the skin, with shuddering and fainting
fits, very frequently follow <em>immediately on conception</em>, and in
many females inform them when that event occurs. Some persons speak of
other sensations, of a peculiar nature, by which they <em>always</em>
know, in their own cases, when they conceive; but these sensations
are felt by so few, and are so little capable of being explained or
observed, that they are of no general use. In most cases, within the
first three months, and sometimes in the first three days, the face
changes remarkably. The eyes are sunk and dull, and surrounded by a
black circle, the nose seems pinched up, the skin turns pale, and red
spots, or freckles, frequently appear. Many females also complain of a
husky dry throat, numbness in the hands and feet, and a sudden<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> sinking
at the heart. These signs, however, are very uncertain guides; very
often none of these are felt at all during pregnancy, and sometimes
they are all experienced from other causes. One of the most constant
signs, according to some, and the most to be relied upon, is an
<em>increase in the size of the neck</em>. This I know is often very
apparent, and at a very early period. I am acquainted with females who,
by simply keeping the measure of their necks, can always tell when
they are pregnant. The increase is often considerable in a few days.
In young persons of a certain temperament however, the neck is apt to
swell merely from <em>marriage</em>, though they do not conceive; and
some old nurses, we are told, being acquainted with this fact, judge of
the honesty of their unmarried charges by such admeasurements!</p>

<p>This singular development is owing, probably, to a sympathetic
connection between the uterine organs and certain parts of the brain,
and large nerves in the neck.</p>

<p><em>Suppression of the Menses</em> is one of the strongest
presumptive signs of pregnancy that can be observed, but does not
always <em>accompany</em> it, and frequently arises from other causes.
In the great majority of cases, it is true, the menses cease to flow,
immediately conception occurs; sometimes they will continue for one
or more periods after, and occasionally during the whole time of
gestation, even up to a few days before delivery. This, however,
is a very unusual occurrence, and the stoppage of the menses is by
no means so strong a sign that pregnancy <em>has</em> occurred, as
their continuance is that it has <em>not</em>. Some females are
always irregular, so that pregnancy makes little difference, and
in them of course these signs are even less to be depended upon
than usual. There have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85"
id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> cases been known even of women who have
conceived without having <em>menstruated</em>, and of others who
never menstruated except when they were pregnant; and it is not at
all unusual to see others who will conceive while nursing, and never
menstruate between the two pregnancies. Therefore we can only say that
the menses <em>usually</em> stop when conception occurs, and that their
continuance is strong evidence that it has not occurred, but still both
signs may fail.</p>

<p>It is also proper to remark that several medical men have advanced
the opinion that the discharge which appears during pregnancy is not
the menstrual fluid, but real blood. It has however been accurately
examined, and found in no respect to differ from the usual discharge.
In my own opinion there is no doubt but that some females really do
menstruate while pregnant.</p>

<p>As an instance that the presence of the menses is no proof
that pregnancy has <em>not</em> occurred, I give the following
case:&mdash;Not long since I was requested to see a lady who was
supposed to labor under a polypus in the womb. She had been married six
years, but had no offspring. On seeing her I suggested, from certain
peculiarities in her appearance and manner, that <em>possibly</em> she
might be pregnant. The suggestion was met with a smile, particularly by
the medical attendant who was present, and I was told that there was no
sign of such a thing, and moreover it <em>could not be</em>, for she
had never stopped menstruating, nor was there the slightest change in
the breasts, nor any disturbance in the stomach, mind, or feelings. On
making the usual examination however, I felt fully <em>convinced</em>
I was right, and told them so, but my opinion had no other effect than
to induce them not to interfere for a time. They had been talking<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> of an
<em>operation</em> immediately. She still continued to menstruate for
three months after, but in six weeks from her last period was safely
delivered, without assistance, of a very fine living child. No part of
the body had undergone any material change, except the abdomen, though
many of the usual changes occurred after delivery. In this case the
delay probably saved the lives of both mother and child, and deeply
grateful they all were for the escape. In my work on the Diseases of
Woman many fatal cases will be found of pregnant females who have been
killed from mistakes of this kind, owing to a blind reliance on such
uncertain signs.</p>

<p><i>Disturbance of the Digestive Functions.</i>&mdash;It is very seldom,
indeed, that pregnancy does not produce more or less disturbance in
these functions, though it must be remarked that <em>marriage</em> also
does the same sometimes, even without conception. These disturbances
are generally manifested by loss of appetite; sickness, particularly in
the morning; vomiting, and depraved taste; the individual frequently
taking a fancy to the most extraordinary articles, and making herself
extremely unhappy if she cannot obtain them. Thus some have eaten
flies, spiders, mice, and other living things, and others again have
regaled themselves upon charcoal, chalk, slate pencils, and even earth
or ashes. Such freaks are called <em>longings</em>, and it is thought
highly improper not to indulge them, which is certainly right when they
are for articles not positively injurious; but I have known this notion
carried to a very injurious and absurd extent. There is no doubt but
these vagaries of the stomach arise, mainly, from its sympathy with the
uterus, but it is highly probable that they are often exaggerated, and
frequently even produced, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> morbid state of the sensibilities, and
by vacuity of mind. The tendency to imitation also, so strong in most
females, often leads to the same result. A young female who is declared
to be, or who fancies herself, pregnant, listens eagerly to all that
is said about that interesting state, by older acquaintances, and when
told that <em>they</em> always <em>longed</em>, immediately begins
to long also. I have known young persons considerably advanced in
gestation, who had never longed at all before, do so immediately after
a conversation of this kind. It must be remembered however, that the
sympathies of the digestive organs with the womb are very strong, and
that the appetite and taste are frequently rendered very capricious
at this time, so that the female really likes or dislikes many things
that she did not before; but still I feel convinced that the absurd
ways in which this caprice exhibits itself, are often owing to the
causes I have stated. The wondering ignorance, in which most females
are kept, makes them disposed to be led away by a morbid imagination,
and constantly liable to be imposed upon by silly and erroneous
statements, which they of course implicitly believe. These longings
are always the strangest, and most frequently met with, among the most
uninformed and unthinking, though they are occasionally met with under
all circumstances. As a sign of pregnancy this longing is not much to
be relied upon alone, because marriage alone often produces it, and so
do many uterine derangements.</p>

<p>Usually all these disturbances disappear by the third or fourth
month, the appetite becomes regular, and sometimes even voracious, and
the digestion improves, so that the individual may become quite fat,
though previously she was very thin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"
id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Some suffer from constipation, and others from diarrhœa, but this is
more rare.</p>

<p><i>Nervous Derangements.</i>&mdash;The changes produced in the minds and
feelings of pregnant females are sometimes of the most extraordinary
character. Individuals who possess, ordinarily, the most agreeable
tempers, and the most amiable dispositions, will become peevish and
fretful, and often even violently passionate and malicious. Some have
even been known to have a disposition to commit various crimes, of
which they had the greatest horror in their natural state. Others,
on the contrary, who are usually ill-tempered and unhappy, attain
a charming tenderness of manner, and a most pleasing serenity of
mind. Their likings and dislikings also change very much, so that
their most valued friends will become hateful to them, and those
whom they habitually dislike will seem endowed with every loveable
quality. Some will become perfect misanthropes, or weep and fret
without intermission, while others will exhibit the most reckless and
boisterous gaiety. I have known some much disposed to study while
pregnant, and others who would draw, or paint, most excellently,
though at other times they were but indifferent artists. In short, it
is impossible to denote half the singular changes of this kind that
are thus produced. Suffice it to say that, when well marked, they
are strong presumptive signs of pregnancy, especially when coming in
connection with other evidences. It must be remembered however, that
hysteria, and some other uterine diseases, are often accompanied by
similar changes.</p>

<p><i>Alteration in the appearance of the Breast.</i>&mdash;The direct,
and sympathetic connection between the womb and the breast is so
great that pregnancy usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"
id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> causes corresponding changes in both,
though not always. In most cases however, the breasts swell, and
become painful. The nipple becomes elevated, and the circle around it
assumes a dark brown color, and is dotted with small tubercles, from
which a thin watery liquor may often be pressed. The nipple will also
enlarge, or become erect on being rubbed, and, as gestation advances,
milk may be forced from it. Most of these signs however, may be wanting
in pregnancy, and may arise independent of it. Chronic inflammation,
and other diseases of the womb, will frequently produce them, as may
be seen in my "Diseases of Woman." <em>Marriage</em> alone frequently
causes such symptoms, particularly in certain temperaments, and
deranged menstruation will frequently produce them.</p>

<p>The alteration in the color of the areola, or circle round the
nipple, is a sign much relied upon by some, but is frequently a
deceptive one, merely from want of close observation. I have known
many females, though frequently mothers, whose breasts always retained
the bright rosy color they had previous to marriage; and I have known
young unmarried females with the breasts quite dark. The peculiar
hue that arises from pregnancy however, is different from anything
I ever saw in non-pregnant females; and, though not always to be
met with, is, in my opinion, an infallible sign when present. The
celebrated John Hunter regarded this sign as an unmistakeable one,
and he gave a remarkable instance of it in his lectures. In making a
<em>post mortem</em> examination of the body of a young female, he
observed this peculiar color, and at once proclaimed her pregnant,
<em>though the hymen was unbroken</em>. On dissection he was found to
be correct&mdash;she was four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"
id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> months advanced. If this sign were
constant, pregnancy could nearly always be ascertained, but frequently
it does not appear. The peculiar color must be seen to be recognized,
as it cannot be accurately described; perhaps the nearest approach
to it is the shell of a fresh <em>ripe chestnut</em>, but it is much
darker in some than in others. The dark circle is nearly always more
elevated than the rest of the breast, as may be seen by taking a
profile view.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Most frequently the breasts do not swell, nor the areola change
color, nor the tubercles appear, till about the fourth month, and
frequently much later.</p>

<p>All these changes in the breast are also liable to become more
or less permanent, after the first pregnancy, so that they are of
much less service, and less to be depended upon, in all succeeding
ones. They also remain, with most females, during nursing, and
are therefore not available in those who conceive while they are
nursing. On the whole however, these signs, especially in those
not previously pregnant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"
id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> may be pretty confidently relied upon, and
will seldom deceive an experienced observer.</p>

<p><i>The secretion of milk</i> is, by most persons, considered a positive
sign of pregnancy, but it is not so, for it sometimes takes place in
young girls merely from the establishment of puberty, and in some
females it always occurs at each monthly period, though they have
never been pregnant. Instances have been known of women nursing other
people's children though they had never conceived themselves.</p>

<p><i>Miscellaneous signs.</i>&mdash;There are a few other presumptive
signs, not easily classified, some of which are of value, while others
are so uncertain, or so little available, as to be almost worthless.
All these however, it is necessary to point out, because some of
them may be made use of in cases where the more ordinary signs are
absent.</p>

<p>In the unimpregnated state the mucus membrane, which lines the
Vagina, is of a bright rose color, but in nearly every case of
pregnancy it changes to a bluish, or purplish hue. I do not recollect
a single instance, in the course of my own observation, in which this
change has not occurred, and the same statement is made by several
eminent authors. It is true that in some young females the mucus
lining is naturally darker than it is in others, but, like the areola
round the nipple, this natural tinge is not like that produced by
pregnancy. It is of course impossible to say whether this blue tinge
is <em>always</em> produced, though I am inclined to think it is, and
I should certainly consider it an almost infallible sign when present.
Parent Duchatelet states that he was present when M. Jacquemin proved
this, without a single failure, <em>in four thousand five hundred
cases</em>.</p>

<p>Many females are also warned of their condition<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> by pains
in various parts of their bodies, the most frequent of which is one
felt at <em>the top of the head</em>. Some always have palpitation at
the heart, and others experience a singular kind of <em>fluttering</em>
in the womb.</p>

<p>Many medical men rely altogether on certain peculiarities in the
<em>urine</em>, and as this sign is really a valuable one, in some
cases, I will describe the mode of examination fully. The urine is put
in a clean vessel, and allowed to stand perfectly still. In a short
time, varying from two to six days, a number of little opaque bodies
begin to rise from the bottom, like flocks of cotton, which unite
together at the top into a thin but firm layer, or pellicle, like cream
on the top of milk. This layer is frequently so consistent that it can
almost be raised out of the vessel, by taking hold of one edge, and may
be easily drawn out by passing the finger under it. This substance is
called <em>kyestein</em>. It is of a whitish color, semi-transparent,
and looks as if it were partly crystalized. After a few days, if left
undisturbed, the urine becomes thick and muddy, and the pellicle of
kyestein breaks up and falls to the bottom. According to the experience
of many medical men, and so far as I have seen myself, this peculiar
substance is <em>always</em> to be found in the urine of pregnant
females, after the first month, and frequently even earlier. Sometimes
a substance <em>similar</em> to it is observed in the urine of those
not pregnant, but there is, in most of these cases, sufficient
difference between them to enable any one, who has seen both, to
distinguish one from the other. The only time, except during gestation,
when real kyestein appears to be formed, is while the milk is being
secreted and not freely discharged. Thus it may often be found when the
female is weaning, and, some writers assure us, in some cases<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> during
the whole period of nursing. On the whole this sign is a very valuable
one, and may be much relied upon.</p>

<p>The changes in the pulse, on which some persons rely, are of no
value whatever as a sign of pregnancy, since they are no more frequent,
and not at all different, so far as I have seen, from what ordinarily
occur from other causes.</p>

<p>The development of the abdomen, though an invariable accompaniment
of pregnancy, is by no means a certain sign of it, since it may be
produced by other causes; and besides, it is sometimes but little to
be observed till a late period. The peculiar manner of the development
however, is usually somewhat different from that produced by tumors,
and other diseases. Very often the abdomen will be tolerably large by
the second month, and then again become so much smaller that the female
will think she is certainly not pregnant. This is owing chiefly to
flatulence, produced by digestive disturbance during the early periods,
but which afterwards subsides. In a short time however, the uterus not
only enlarges more, but rises, and the development becomes permanent.
This circumstance of there being often <em>two</em> developments has
deceived many, and I have known females declared to be not pregnant,
simply because the development of the abdomen went down, who, in a
short time after, exhibited unequivocal evidences of being in that
condition. The first development, or swelling, is merely similar to
what often arises from indigestion, and other causes, and is therefore
no sign of pregnancy; but the second development is accompanied by
other changes, besides being more permanent.</p>

<p>The linea alba, or white line, which may be seen<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
extending from the navel to the pubis, in the ordinary state, becomes
much darker, the skin of the abdomen wrinkles, and the umbilicus, or
navel, becomes prominent.</p>

<p>Swelling of the eyelids, and puffing of the face, are experienced
by some females, but are not very general, and so frequently result
from other causes that they are of little value as evidences in this
case.</p>

<p>This, I believe, comprises all the presumptive signs of Pregnancy
that are worthy of notice. Some of them are valuable and may be
depended upon, particularly the presence of kyestein in the urine,
which may almost be called a <em>certain</em> sign. Others of them are
of little value alone, but are useful in the way of corroboration. The
more there are of them observed together, in any case, of course the
more grounds there are for the <em>presumption</em> that pregnancy
exists, and the reverse.</p>

<p>It must be carefully remembered however, that these presumptive
signs are precisely those most likely to be produced by other causes,
particularly by <em>marriage only</em>; they must therefore be well
weighed, and unless very numerous, or very distinctly marked, must
not be regarded as conclusive. As already remarked, it is only during
<em>the first three months</em> that most of these presumptive signs
are taken much notice of; after that we have others that can be
more depended upon, and which will be described in the succeeding
articles.</p>


<h5>PROBABLE SIGNS.</h5>

<p><i>End of the third month.</i>&mdash;The probable signs now to be
described are seldom recognized before this time, and not generally
with distinctness till a still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"
id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> later period. They chiefly consist of
certain changes in the form, development, and position of different
parts of the uterus, to ascertain which requires an internal
examination. These changes are not observable till the end of the
third month, previous to which time we cannot be certain that the womb
has really increased beyond its normal size. And even then, when the
increase is obvious, we cannot tell how it has been produced; it is
not till a much later period, till five or six, or even seven months
are elapsed, that pregnancy can be ascertained with anything like
certainty.</p>

<p>The changes to be noticed are in the form, and size, of the neck and
body of the womb, and in its mouth, and also in the weight of the whole
organ. No one, of course, can expect to recognize these changes who is
not acquainted with the parts in the unimpregnated state, both in the
virgin and in those who have borne children.</p>

<p>The mode of conducting the requisite examination is, by introducing
the index finger of the right hand, covered with oil or mucilage, into
the Vagina, and then carrying it upwards till it reaches the Os Tincæ.
By means of this finger the position and length of the neck of the womb
are ascertained, and also the state of its mouth, whether it is opened
or closed, and to what extent. If it be then placed at the top of the
neck, on the under side, and the other hand upon the fundus of the womb
externally, and pressing firmly upon it, the organ is enclosed as it
were between the two hands, so that its size and form may be pretty
accurately ascertained, and also its degree of firmness, by which a
judgment may be formed as to whether it is occupied by any solid body,
or fluid, or whether it is empty. In addition to this a pretty<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
accurate estimate may be made of its comparative <em>weight</em>,
by <em>balancing</em>, and raising it up on the finger. This is
called by the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ballotment</i>,
and, as will be shown further on, is a valuable means, at
certain stages, of ascertaining pregnancy.&mdash;(See Plate <a
href="#Page_107">XVI.</a>)</p>

<p>The female may be examined either standing or lying down, though
the recumbent position is best, except in certain displacements of the
womb, when it is most likely to be thrown into a position in which
the neck can easily be reached by the female standing. The position
of the neck is very different in many of these displacements, and
during pregnancy, to what it is in the ordinary state, and a person not
acquainted with these changes might frequently be much puzzled to find
it. As we have already remarked, also, there are certain differences
between those who have had children and those who have not. The
following three diagrams represent the changes just spoken of at three
different periods:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will readily be seen by these diagrams that the alterations in
the neck and mouth of the womb are very marked, and of a character
easily to be ascertained by the touch. These three should be compared
with the section of the womb in Plate IV, which represents it in the
unimpregnated state.</p>

<p>The difference between those who have borne children, and those who
have not, is well represented in Plate XV,&mdash;the drawings being

<p>Most of the changes produced can be readily distinguished by
the finger, after seeing this representation, and making a proper
comparison between it and the natural state in Plate IV.</p>

<p>The Neck is not much enlarged at this period, but its lower part is
somewhat soft to the feeling. The Os Tincæ is more <em>rounded</em>
than in the unimpregnated state, particularly in the Primipara, in whom
in fact it is nearly circular, the lips being quite smooth and closed.
In the female who has already borne children it is somewhat open, so
that the finger may often be introduced; and the lips feel rough, owing
to scars and laceration in previous deliveries. It is also larger
altogether, and softer, than in the primipara. The whole length of the
neck at this stage is about two inches.</p>

<p>The body of the uterus, when pressed between the two hands, will be
found much larger than ordinary, and more round, and it will feel heavy
when pushed up by the finger.</p>

<p>In regard to the precise value of these probable signs, it can only
be said, when they are observed, that it is certain that the womb is
enlarged, and <em>most probably</em> from pregnancy. But at the same
time it must be remembered that several diseases, and particularly
suppressed and irregular menstruation, or the development of tumors
and polypi, will effect very similar changes, and that it is not
<em>always</em> possible to say whether they arise from these abnormal
growths or from pregnancy, though it can generally be done. But though
we cannot, in every case, say when these signs exist, that the female
must be pregnant, we can nearly always say, when they do not exist,
that she cannot be so, particularly if the other usual signs are
absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"
id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>End of the fourth month.</i>&mdash;By this time the neck has become a
little shorter still, and the mouth more open, but on the whole there
is not much change to be felt internally. The body of the womb however,
has now ascended above the superior strait of the Pelvis, and begins
permanently to enlarge the Abdomen. It may be distinctly felt between
the two hands, like a firm round ball, somewhat elastic, and resisting
when pressed. This is the period when the motions of the fœtus are
usually felt first, and these motions, with the ascension of the womb,
are sometimes experienced very suddenly, so as to alarm the female,
and produce certain curious sensations, with much nervous derangement.
This is called <em>quickening</em>, and, with some persons, is always
so well marked as to indicate not only their condition, but the very
period, with great precision. Many however, never experience anything
at all peculiar at this time.</p>

<p>It is customary for the medical attendant, as a means of making
the child move, to put his hand first in cold water, and then over
the fundus of the uterus; the sensation of cold thus conveyed usually
causing it to move immediately. Great care must be taken however,
that other motions be not mistaken for those of the child, an error
not at all uncommon. Many a female, and many a medical man also, has
been deceived in this way, particularly in cases of uterine or ovarian
dropsy, and tumor, and even in ordinary flatulence and hysteria.
Females who much desire offspring frequently deceive themselves in
this way, and it is sometimes next to impossible to convince them
of their error. Some women possess the power of <em>imitating</em>
the movements of the child, with great exactness; and instances
have been known where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> they have successfully imposed, both on
their friends and medical attendants, for a long time, in this way. Mr.
Dubois mentions instances of females who possessed this extraordinary
power, and who, though not pregnant, used to present themselves
to his class, for the pupils to <em>ascertain the motions of the
child</em>. In short, this sign must not be too much relied upon, nor
too confidently expected, for many females observe no fœtal motions at
all till the sixth or seventh month, and even then very indistinctly.
Sometimes also, after having been distinctly felt, these motions will
altogether stop for a long time, and then appear again.</p>

<p>At this time however, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ballotment</i> can
begin to be practised, though it is not quite so certain as at a month
later. The manner of performing this important manipulation has already
been partly described, and by examining Plate XVI, and attending to the
following remarks, it may be readily understood and practised.</p>

<p>When the right hand finger (1 Plate XVI,) is carried to the top of
the Vagina, it meets with a round soft tumor, which is the head of the
child felt through the walls of the womb. As soon as this is distinctly
felt, the finger must be withdrawn a little, and then pushed suddenly
against the tumor with a jerk; this will displace the fœtus, and cause
it to rise in the liquor amnii towards the Fundus, so that the round
tumor will have disappeared. In a few moments it will sink down and may
be again felt, and again displaced in the same manner. This is called
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ballotment</i>, or balancing it on the
end of the finger. The sensation conveyed on touching the Fœtus, and
when it rises after being pushed, are so peculiar that they are not
likely to be overlooked, or mistaken for anything else, after being
once experienced. The jerk is not required to be at all violent, and
had better be made at first very slight, as it can easily be repeated
a little more forcibly if the tumor does not rise at first. Some
practitioners practice the Ballotment in this way, using the one hand
only; but others place the left hand also on the Abdomen, (4 Plate
XVI,) at the same time, and immediately after jerking <em>upwards</em>
with the right hand, they suddenly depress the Abdomen, just over the
pubes, with the fingers of the left, so as to send the Fœtus down again
more quickly and more forcibly. This is seldom needed, but if the first
way does not succeed the two hands may be tried.</p>

<p>A species of ballotment may even be practised externally, in the
following way:&mdash;The fingers of the right hand are placed on the
Abdomen, just over the fundus of the womb, like the left hand in Plate
XVI, and a smart jerk is given downwards and backwards, several times
in quick succession. This also displaces<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> the Fœtus, which may be
distinctly felt to float away, each time the percussion is made. No one
can mistake this peculiar motion who has once felt it.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of these manœuvres will succeed when the other fails,
so that it is well to practise them all. They may be performed with the
female either standing or lying down, and will sometimes succeed one
way when they will not the other.</p>

<p>It is requisite to remember that in presentations of the breech,
or trunk, the ballotment may not succeed as well as when the head
presents; or it may even fail altogether, so that when it is
unsuccessful we must not immediately conclude there is no pregnancy.
Tumors in the womb, stone in the bladder, and various uterine
displacements, may also create uncertainty, or cause failure, but these
accidents are rarely met with, and only interfere materially at an
early stage; afterwards ballotment can be practised notwithstanding
them, or auscultation may be resorted to.</p>

<p>In short, this mode of detecting pregnancy is one of the most
certain, and the most generally applicable, that we possess.</p>

<p><i>End of the fifth month.</i>&mdash;At this time the Uterus has
increased considerably in size, and has ascended so high in the
Abdomen that the Fundus is level with the umbilicus, or navel, in
a first pregnancy, though somewhat lower in those who have borne
children before. This rising of the womb makes the Vagina longer, and
brings the neck of the womb nearer to its centre. In the previous
stage the neck was thrown so far back that it was difficult to reach,
but now it is much more favorably situated, though much higher.
Its substance is softer than before, and the two lips are nearly
on a level, and somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111"
id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> opened, particularly in those who have
borne children before. Indeed, in them the point of the finger may be
introduced, as seen below:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ballotment is now much more easily practised, and is more
conclusive. A new sign is also to be distinguished, by which we are
furnished with another valuable means of detecting pregnancy. The
child's heart begins to beat so strongly, and its circulation is
so vigorous, that the <em>sound</em> of it can be <em>heard</em>
externally. The same means are taken to ascertain this that are
used in sounding the chest of an adult. If the ear be placed on the
Abdomen, over the womb, the beating of the fœtal heart may<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> be
heard quite plainly; and if the stethoscope be used it will be still
more distinct. This practice is called <em>Auscultation</em>. The signs
furnished by it are certainly of the greatest value, and frequently
enable us to detect pregnancy with unerring certainty. Indeed, not
only can we tell by them that a child is in the womb, but often even
<em>the very position in which it lies</em>, and whether there be
<em>twins</em>, <em>or more</em>. This is done by noting where the
heart is situated, by the sound, and whether the beating is single or
double.</p>

<p>The nature of these sounds, and the manner of detecting them,
require to be carefully explained.</p>

<p>If the person wishing to notice this sign is not already familiar
with the beating of the adult heart, he had better become so first.
The ear should be placed on the left side of a grown up person, on
the skin, just beneath the breast, and held very still. The heart
will then be heard to beat very distinctly, there being two sounds,
a long one and a short one, alternating with each other. When this
has been listened to for some time, the ear will be able to catch any
similar sound, and the auscultation may then be practised to detect
pregnancy.</p>

<p>The ear must be placed on the Abdomen, about midway between the
Pubes and the umbilicus, and towards the left side. No weight should
be borne on the body, but the ear must be laid sufficiently close
to exclude all external sounds, and no motion should take place,
particularly with the clothes. If the sound be not heard in the
position first assumed, move a little, in different directions,
till that point is attained where it is most distinct. It can
scarcely fail to be heard, with ordinary care. A practised ear will
sometimes distinguish the sound as early as the fourth month, but
generally it cannot be heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> before the end of the fifth, or even
till the sixth month. There are several sounds that may either be
mistaken for it, or that may confuse the ear. The beating of the
mother's heart will sometimes be very distinct, as far as the lower
part of the Abdomen, but it is much slower; the child's heart throbbing
nearly twice as fast. The movements of the Fœtus, and the rumbling of
the intestines, will also interfere; but when once the proper sound has
been caught it may be kept independently of all these.</p>

<p>The manner in which the child lies in the womb will determine where
the heart shall be opposite, and as its position frequently varies,
both in different individuals, and at different periods, in the same
person, the sound must be sought for at several points, till the right
one is found. The most usual position will be seen in several of our
plates, and they will give sufficient indication to enable almost any
one to practise this mode of detection with success. During the early
months the child moves about a good deal, so that the sound may be
heard one day in one place, and the next in another. About the seventh
month however, it becomes more fixed, so that the place of the heart
can be pretty certainly ascertained, and thus the <em>position</em> of
the whole body is made out, whether the head is downwards or upward,
and a tolerable idea can be formed even as to the direction of each
part.</p>

<p>Many persons have failed in their attempts to hear the Fœtal
pulsation, but I cannot but think it must have been either from
inattention, or from not being acquainted with the sound of the heart
at all. I never recollect an instance when I could not do so, at the
proper time. M. Chailly says he does not hesitate to affirm that in
every instance they can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> detected; and M. P. Dubois distinctly
heard them in one hundred and eighty-five females, out of one hundred
and ninety-five, in the other ten the child being probably dead.
Indeed, the absence of this sound is the most certain sign of the death
of the Fœtus, as its existence is of its being alive; and medical men
now tell whether the child is dead or not by these very means.</p>

<p>In conducting the auscultation the female must recline, and keep
as still as possible, breathing low. The Abdomen may be covered with
a single thin garment, if absolutely insisted upon; but the judgment
will be so much the more uncertain, owing both to the deadening of the
sound and to the friction of the material. The experimenter must also
recollect that if the head be held down too long, the blood will rush
to it, and cause a humming in the ears, which will confuse him; it will
therefore be better if the bed be high.</p>

<p>It is always best to use the <em>stethoscope</em>, as it covers
only a small space, conveys the sound more directly, and shuts out
external noises more effectually. This instrument is extremely simple,
consisting merely of a tube of wood, glass, metal, gum elastic, or
almost any other material. One end should be expanded a little,
like a bell, and the other made small, so as to fit close in the
ear&mdash;the large end being placed on the Abdomen. It may be about a
foot in length, though a little shorter or longer will not make much
difference. I once used a child's <em>tin trumpet</em>, having no
regular stethoscope with me, and succeeded with it perfectly. The large
end should be pressed on the Abdomen, and the smaller one into the
ear, sufficiently close to shut out all other sounds but those coming
from the body. This is the same instrument<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> that the lungs are
sounded with, when we want to judge of their action and condition.</p>

<p>This is an invaluable means of detecting pregnancy; in fact,
at the proper time, and with due care, it may be said to be
<em>certain</em>.</p>

<p><i>End of the sixth month.</i>&mdash;This is the period when, according
to the law, the child can live. There are no new signs at this time,
but those previously noticed are now more distinct. The neck of the
womb is still softer and shorter, and the finger can penetrate further
in the passage than before. The fundus of the womb is now above the
umbilicus, in primipara, though not so high in those who have borne
children; and the bladder is above the superior strait.</p>

<p>Ballotment can now be practised with certainty, the falling and
rising of the Fœtus being very distinct.</p>

<p>Auscultation also becomes more positive, the sounds being louder and
more easily ascertained.</p>

<p><i>End of the seventh month.</i>&mdash;The fundus of the womb has now
risen still higher, and the Bladder is pushed completely above the
upper strait, so that the whole length of the Urethra lies behind the
pubic bone. It is then much pressed upon and swollen, and being much
longer, and bent out of its usual course, the urine is often passed
with difficulty, and the catheter can scarcely be introduced. The
upper part of the Womb now lies over towards the <em>right side</em>
of the body, very evidently. This direction is nearly constant, in
all females, but the reason for it is not known. There have been
many theories to account for the peculiarity, but none of them are
either so plausible, or so well supported by facts, as to be generally
adopted.</p>

<p>The upper part of the Womb being tilted to the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> right
side, the neck of course points to the left, and backwards. It is now
very short, even in primipara, but in those who have borne children
it is scarcely to be distinguished at all. The finger may now be
introduced, even in primipara, half way up the neck; and in others it
will reach even into the uterine cavity.</p>

</div>

<p>The part below the lower line here, shows that part of the neck
which is contained in the Vagina. It will easily be seen how much
shorter this part is, and how much more open the passage is, in the
female who has borne children, than in a first pregnancy.</p>

<p>Ballotment and Auscultation both, now afford unmistakeable evidences
as to the condition of the patient.</p>

<p><i>End of the eighth month.</i>&mdash;By referring to the preceding<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Plates, it will be seen that the part of the neck of the Womb
<em>above</em> the Vagina, which is placed between the two dotted cross
lines, remains almost unchanged, while the part <em>within</em> the
Vagina, or that below the lowest line, becomes less and less, till at
this time, in those who have borne children, it can scarcely be felt at
all; and even in a primipara it is merely like a small tubercle. About
this time however, the upper part of the neck begins to shorten also,
though that is not so obvious, and therefore not so useful for our
present purpose.</p>

<p>On making an examination, the mouth of the Womb itself may now be
felt, at the upper part of the Vagina, and far back. It is however,
very difficult to reach, on account of its position. The finger will
now pass, in those who have previously borne children, into the cavity
of the Womb itself, but in others it will scarcely reach so far.</p>

<p>The linea alba becomes darker at this period, and so does the areola
around the nipple. Certain peculiar marks also appear on the Abdomen,
and upper part of the thighs, almost like the <em>pits</em> from small
pox. They are usually diamond shaped, slightly depressed, and dark
in color. They appear to be owing to the over stretching of some of
the parts under the cuticle, and which give way in consequence. In
first pregnancies, and in those who enlarge very much, these marks are
sometimes very numerous, and remain for a long time after delivery,
sometimes even they never disappear. As signs of pregnancy however,
they are but of little value, because they are often produced by other
causes that distend the Womb. None of these presumptive signs are now
needed, and therefore they are of little consequence, because there are
others more certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The motions of the child itself can now be generally both felt and
seen, and an experienced observer may even predicate from them, with
tolerable certainty, the position in which it lies. Ballotment, by
one hand on the Abdomen, may still be practised with success; but in
the Vagina it is difficult, because the Fœtus is both more fixed and
heavier.</p>

<p>Auscultation is now the surest dependence however, and may be
advantageously resorted to also as a means of determining beforehand
the position of the child. This may be done even a month earlier, but
not so certainly as now.</p>

<p>To understand how this important point is determined, it is only
necessary to recollect, as will be very evident, that the pulsation
will be heard the loudest immediately over the heart; and as we know
the form and general size of the Fœtus, and the manner in which it
usually lies, it becomes possible, when the position of its heart is
discovered, to trace out, from that, the position of every other part.
This will be evident by referring to Plates XIX, XX, and XXI. It will
then be seen that, if a line be drawn across the middle of the Abdomen,
the heart will be <em>above</em> that line when the breech presents,
and <em>below</em> it when the head presents, and on the right or left
side, as the case may be, in each position.</p>

<p>In case of twins there will be two pulsations, and they so much
interfere with each other that it is difficult to distinguish either.
The two children being generally disposed with the head of one to the
heels of the other, one heart will be <em>above</em> the line, and the
other <em>below</em>, on opposite sides, as shown in Plate XXII.</p>

<p>At this period the signs previously observed become more distinct,
but there are few new ones. The external lips sometimes swell, and the
breathing becomes more difficult, owing to pressure on the diaphragm.
The trouble with the urine is also apt to increase, and little mucus
tubercles, like pimples, occasionally form around the Os Tincæ, and on
the upper part of the Vagina.</p>

<p><i>End of the ninth month.</i>&mdash;There is but little difference

still a small portion of the neck left.</p>

<p class="space-above5">Ballotment is now more obscure than before,
as the Fœtus is very heavy, and quite low down, and pretty firmly
fixed. Auscultation is distinct enough, but not more so than at the
previous period. The swelling of the lips, and of the veins of the
legs, may increase, and so may the difficulty with the urine; but the
breathing generally becomes easier, owing to the Womb having descended
a little, and so pressing the diaphragm less.</p>

<p>These comprise all the signs and indications of pregnancy that
possess any real value. Some of them, at certain times, and under
particular circumstances, may be called <em>positive</em>; such
as those discovered by Ballotment and Auscultation, and also the
presence of Kyestein in the urine. Most of the others merely make it
<em>probable</em> that pregnancy exists, or warrant us in presuming
as much. They are not to be depended on implicitly alone, but when
many of them are observed together, and no other cause can be assigned
for their production, the presumption becomes so well supported as
almost to be called a moral certainty. A person of experience, who
is familiar with all these signs, and with the others produced by
disease which resemble them, will seldom find it difficult to decide;
but still there are cases in which pregnancy proceeds, even to its
termination, with but few unusual symptoms, so that both patient and
attendant are completely at fault. This however is very rare, and many
eminent authors contend that it is <em>always</em> possible to detect
pregnancy, <em>after the sixth month</em>, and I think so myself,
unless the child be dead, in which case it will soon be evident in
another way.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>DURATION OF PREGNANCY.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> duration of pregnancy, or the precise
term of Utero Gestation, is not fixed. It appears, from accurate
observation, that there is no absolute period determined by natural
laws, and therefore there is none laid down by human enactments. An
approximation can be made, by taking the average of a number of cases,
and the period of limitation may also be determined in the same way.
The most usual period is about nine months, or from thirty-five to
forty weeks, some females going beyond the thirty-six weeks, and others
not so long. First children are frequently born under the nine months,
and more so than those that come after; this is a fact not generally
known, and ignorance of it has often given rise to unjust suspicions.
It is quite possible for a female to be delivered, with the child at
full period, in a little over eight months after marriage, without
there being any just grounds whatever for suspecting unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>Dr. R. Lee, in his Lectures on the Theory and Practice of Midwifery,
gives the best summary that we have in the language, of our information
on this subject; I will therefore quote from his work, making such
comments and additions as I may think advisable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Roman law fixed the period of gestation at ten lunar months.
The civil code of Prussia ordains that a child born 302 days
after the death of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> husband shall be considered legitimate.
By the law of France, the legitimacy of a child cannot be called in
question who is born 300 days after the death or departure of the
husband. The laws of England declare that the usual period of human
utero-gestation is nine calendar months, or forty weeks; farther than
this they do not fix a definite period: the law is not exact as to a
few days. Nine calendar months contain only 275 days, and only 273 or
272 if February be included. To fix bastardy on a child in Scotland,
absence must continue till within six months of the birth, and a child
born after the tenth month is accounted illegitimate.</p>

<p>"The difficulty of determining the precise time when impregnation
takes place in the human subject, renders it almost impossible,
in any case, to calculate with absolute certainty the duration of
pregnancy. We are, however, in possession of a sufficient number of
observations to establish the fact that the ordinary period is about
forty weeks, or 280 days; but it is certain that it does occasionally
exceed or fall short of this period by several days. As we can never
be certain of the precise day, between the periods of menstruation,
when conception occurs&mdash;whether it takes place immediately after
the last period, or before the expected period, or midway between
these&mdash;it is obvious that all calculations founded upon the
cessation of the catamenia must be extremely uncertain. The error of
the calculation will be still greater if the catamenia should have
appeared, or a discharge like the catamenia should have occurred once
or twice after conception. Impregnation most frequently takes place
soon after menstruation, but in others it does not happen till a few
days before the expected period; so that two<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> women may have
menstruated at the same time, and one may have reached the full
period three weeks before the other; and to this extent, or nearly
so, an opinion founded on the disappearance of the catamenia may be
erroneous.</p>

<p>"Calculations of the duration of pregnancy, founded upon what has
been observed to occur after casual intercourse, or perhaps a single
act, in individuals who can have no motive to tell us what is false,
are likely to be much more correct; and the conclusion to be drawn from
these is, that labor usually, but not invariably, comes on about 280
days after conception, a mature child being sometimes born before the
expiration of forty weeks, and at other times not until the forty weeks
have been exceeded by several days. A case came under my observation
very lately, in which I had no doubt the pregnancy existed 287 days:
the labor did not take place till 287 days had elapsed from the
departure of the husband of this lady for the East Indies. Some women
are always delivered before the end of the forty weeks, according to
the usual calculation, and their children are mature.</p>

<p>"In the evidence given on the Gardner Peerage cause, the period
of utero-gestation was limited, but not strictly, by some of the
witnesses, to forty weeks, or 280 days; by others it was extended
to 311 days. Dr. Merriman, whose opinion is always entitled to much
respect, thinks the greatest number of women complete gestation in
the 40th week, and next to that in the 41st. Of 114 pregnancies,
calculated by him from the last day of menstruation, and in which
the children appeared to be mature, 3 deliveries took place at the
end of the 37th week; 13 in the 38th; 14 in the 39th; 33 in the
40th; 22 in the 41st;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"
id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> 15 in the 42d; 10 in the 43d; and 4 in
the 44th week.</p>

<p>"How long before the expiration of the 40 weeks a child may be born
with the power of supporting life has not been determined. Where I have
induced premature labor for distortion of the pelvis before the end of
the seventh calendar month from the last menstruation, I have never
seen a child reared. The lady of the clergyman in Fife, whose case has
lately given rise to so much discussion, was delivered 175 days after
marriage, and the child lived five months. To what extent gestation may
be protracted in some cases beyond the 280 days it is very difficult
to determine, and the opinions of the most eminent writers differ upon
the subject. I should suspect some great error in the calculation where
the period of gestation exceeded 300 days. But the experiments made on
the lower animals prove that there exists in them a great variation
between the shortest and the longest gestation; and it is difficult
to comprehend why there should be a difference in this respect in the
human species."</p>

</div>

<p>In a trial which took place in this country, in the county of
Lancaster, Pa., as reported in the <cite>Medical Examiner</cite> for
June, 1846, it was decided that Gestation may be prolonged to <em>three
hundred and thirteen days!</em> The female swore that conception must
have taken place on the twenty-third of March, 1845, and the child
was not born till the thirtieth of January, 1846, or over <em>eleven
months</em>. The judge directed the jury to return a verdict in her
favor, and I suppose this case establishes a precedent for America.</p>

<p>In a recent number of the <cite>Medical Gazette</cite>, I
find a case reported wherein the period was said to be<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
prolonged still farther. A man left his wife in New South Wales, he
coming to England, and <em>twelve months</em> after he left she was
delivered of a child, which she claimed to be legitimate. He denied
this however, and the judge in the Consistory Court decided, without
hesitation, in his favor. Taking the medium between these two cases
therefore, it appears to be decided that the <em>extreme limits</em> is
somewhere between <em>eleven</em> and <em>twelve</em> months! It must
be recollected however, that both were perfectly arbitrary, and that,
for anything known positively on the subject, both may be either right
or wrong.</p>

<p>Except when labor is brought on prematurely by violence, it always
commences at what would have been one of the monthly periods; or in
other words, after a certain number of <em>full months</em>, and
never at any time between! If therefore a female passes over the
<em>ninth</em> month, she will probably go to the <em>tenth</em>. This
has been proved by extensive observation, and is only another proof of
the regular method in which nature conducts all her operations. The
same law is also observed in abortions, which generally take place at
one of the months, unless brought on suddenly by violence.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5>PERIOD WHEN THE CHILD CAN LIVE.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> precise period when the child can
live, if brought into the world, is not determined, any more than the
time it may remain in the Womb. Some children may be able to live a
considerable time before the full period of Gestation, and others may
not till some time after, there being a great difference in regard to
their development.</p>

<p>One may be as fully developed at six, as another at seven months.
The common opinion is that the child cannot live if born before
<em>seven months</em>. This, however, is incorrect. Many instances have
been known of births at six months, and even earlier, in which the
child lived, and became strong and healthy. Van Swieten mentions the
case of one Fortunio Liceti, who was born before the sixth month. He
was not larger than the hand, but grew to the average size, and lived
to be seventy-one years old. Dr. Gunning Bedford mentions a similar
case, in his translation of Chailly's Midwifery. There are even cases
mentioned of children living at five months, but it must be borne in
mind that it is seldom possible to determine the exact period. As a
general rule however, the child does not live till after the seventh
month, though there undoubtedly have been cases where it has lived
before the end of the sixth month. The law adopts the medium period,
and declares the child capable of living at <em>the end of the sixth
month</em>, and not before. There is no reason whatever for supposing
that it is less likely to live at eight months than at seven, or that
it will not live at all at eight months, as some do.</p>

<p class="ph4">FORM AND SIZE OF THE FŒTUS AT FULL TERM.</p>


<h5>SIZE AND FORM OF THE BODY.</h5>

<p>The average length of the Fœtus, at full term, is about twelve
inches from the head to the breech, and about eighteen inches from the
head to the feet. Its weight varies from five to eight pounds, perhaps
averaging about six, though some have been born weighing only three
pounds, or less, and some even as high as twelve. The breadth across
the shoulders is about four inches, and the same across the hips, but
both are so easily compressed that during delivery they only measure
about three inches, or three and a half at most.</p>


<h5>SIZE AND FORM OF THE HEAD.</h5>

<p>The head is the most important part, because it is the largest, and
usually present first. It is therefore necessary to describe it fully,
and with special reference to its importance, in the early stages of
labor, as the part by which the position is usually determined.</p>

</p>

<p>The bones of the cranium are not closed together, as they are in the
adult, but are separated to a considerable distance, in certain parts,
and connected by a strong membrane. These membranous spaces are called
<em>Sutures</em> and <em>Fontanelles</em>, and a knowledge of them is
absolutely necessary, as a means of ascertaining the position of the
head.</p>

<p><i>The Sutures.</i>&mdash;The first of these spaces, which extends from
the lowest part of the middle of the forehead to the occipital bone, is
called the <em>Sagittal Suture</em>, or antero posterior Suture: A, B,
C, Figs. 1 and 2. It separates the two frontal, and the two parietal
bones. The spaces between the two frontal and the two parietal bones
are called the <em>Frontal Parietal Sutures</em>, <i>o. o.</i> Fig. 1; and
those between the two parietal bones and the occipital, <i>l. l.</i> Figs. 1
and 2, are called the <em>Lambdoidal Sutures</em>.</p>

<p><i>The Fontanelles.</i>&mdash;When the different Sutures meet at a point,
the membranous space is greater than at other parts, and is called
a Fontanelle. Thus when the two Frontal Parietal Sutures meet the
Sagittal Suture, at B, Figs. 1 and 2, there is quite a large diamond
shaped space between the different bones, filled up with membrane.
This is called the <em>Anterior Fontanelle</em>, or bregma. Where the
Sagittal Suture joins the two Lambdoidal there is another space, not
so large, and different in shape, being triangular; this is called
the <em>Posterior Fontanelle</em>, <i>c.</i> Figs. 1 and 2. And where each
of the temporal bones joins the parietal there are two other spaces,
called the <em>Temporal Fontanelles</em>, <i>t.</i> Fig. 2, which are also
irregularly diamond shaped, but not nearly so large as the anterior
fontanelle.</p>

<p>It is evident that if a person can distinguish these Fontanelles,
when he touches them with his finger, he<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> can tell what part of
the head is presenting, and hence their use.</p>

<p>These spaces allow of the bones lapping over each other, during
delivery, and thus the head is made smaller. They do not disappear
till sometime after birth, and in very young children the brain may be
felt, and seen to work, at the anterior fontanelle. Eventually however,
the bones come close together, and are joined by a curious kind of
dovetailing. The two frontal bones however, completely coalesce, and
form but one, in the adult.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bones will be very perfectly formed, and the
fontanelles nearly filled up, before birth, and then the head cannot
be crushed much smaller, and so the labor becomes both painful and
difficult. This is usually called an ossified, or solid head.</p>

<p><i>Diameters of the Head.</i>&mdash;The diameters of the head are the
distances between its most prominent points. They are necessary to be
known before we can judge as to the possibility of its passing the
straits of the Pelvis, in the various positions.</p>

<p>Generally there are reckoned <em>ten</em> diameters, and they are
represented in the following Plate:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"

<p>The necessity for knowing these diameters will be obvious. It is
only by being acquainted with them, and with the straits of the Pelvis,
already described, that we can tell whether the child can pass or
not in certain positions, and how we must change its position, when
possible, to give relief.</p>

<p>On comparing the diameters of the head with those of the Pelvis,
it will be seen that some of them correspond in size while others do
not, so that in one position delivery can take place spontaneously,
while in another it will be difficult, and in some nearly impossible,
without assistance. Thus, for instance, if the head should present by
the occipito mental diameter, (O, M, Fig. 1,) it evidently could not
pass while in that position, because by this diameter it is five inches
in width, and the greatest diameter of the Pelvis is only about four
inches and a half. Its position must therefore be changed, and the
accoucheur must know how to change it with advantage.</p>


<h5>ATTITUDE OF THE FŒTUS AT FULL TERM.</h5>

<p>The attitude of the Fœtus is represented in the following
Plate:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153"

  <div class="caption">

    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="caption">

    <p>The arms, it will be seen, are crossed on the breast, upon which the
chin is also bent; the thighs are close together, and brought against
the Abdomen; the legs are close bent on the Thighs, and the feet are
turned up against the front of the legs, the whole body being curved
forward.</p>

  </div>

</div>

<p>The position in which the Fœtus most usually lies in the Womb has
already been shown, particularly in Plate XII, and in Plate XVI. The
head is downwards, and the back part of it turned to the mother's
left side. What is the cause of this almost universal position is not
certainly known. It was formerly thought to depend on the head being
heavier than the other parts, and thus sinking down; but this<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
supposition has been shown to be entirely without foundation. M. P.
Dubois has lately advanced the notion that it depends on an instinctive
feeling in the Fœtus itself, which directs it to take that position
by which it can most easily make its exit. This opinion appears very
reasonable, and is apparently well founded. It is well known that the
Fœtus is susceptible of various impressions while in the Womb, and
impelled by unerring instinct to take the breast immediately it is
born; nay, it has even been known to suck the finger of the assistant,
in cases of face presentation, even before birth! We can readily
believe, therefore, that it is directed to place itself in the Womb, in
the best position, the same as it is directed to take the finger in its
mouth.</p>

<p>In the young of many of the lower animals this is also strikingly
exemplified. The young duck in the shell taps with its little beak
against the part that is to be broken, and rushes into the water even
with a part of the shell still on its back. The young oppossums, who
are born imperfect from the Womb, shelter themselves, immediately they
come into the world, in the pouch on the mother's breast, and fasten
themselves to the mammæ till they are more perfectly grown.</p>

<p>It must be remarked however, that the head does not <em>always</em>
present first, though it usually does so. Occasionally we have the
breech present, and still rarer even other parts; but these are merely
exceptional deviations, the causes of which are unknown. Out of every
sixteen children born, <em>fifteen</em> usually come head first. This
however, will be shown better further on.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<h5>THE APPENDAGES OF THE FŒTUS AT TERM.</h5>


<h5>THE MEMBRANES.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> uses and arrangements of the
membranes surrounding the Fœtus have already been explained, so that
little more is needed to be said here, because they are not much
different at the full term from what they are at an earlier period,
excepting perhaps that the <em>amnion</em> is a little more dense and
firm. This membrane appears not only to surround the Fœtus like a bag,
to contain the waters, but is also reflected close on to its body, like
its skin, with which in fact it is thought by some to be connected. The
child is certainly born with this membrane still on its body, and does
not part with it till some days after birth, when it peels off like a
thin dead skin, or powder.</p>

<p>The <em>waters</em>, enclosed within the Amnion, (see Plate <a
href="#Page_65">XII</a>,) have now increased to their greatest
quantity; and there is also, in most cases, a second body of fluid
between the Amnion and the Chorion, which coming away before the real
discharge, is called the <em>false waters</em>.&mdash;(See Plate <a
href="#Page_65">XII</a>.)</p>

<p>The quantity of the true waters, at birth, is about twenty, or from
that to thirty ounces, but is very variable. It is of a greenish color,
rather muddy, and heavier than water. It contains albumen, (white
of egg,) sulphate of soda, and lime. Ninety-eight per cent. of it
however, is pure water. It appears to be excreted, like perspiration,
from the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> the membranes, and most likely is merely
the watery portion of the blood exuded through. The uses of this fluid
are various. As already stated, it probably supplies some nutriment to
the fœtus, which it also protects, in a great measure, from pressure
and from concussions. It also prevents the limbs from adhering, and
helps to distend the mouth of the Womb, in the earlier stages of
labor, besides affording an abundant slippery fluid for the purpose of
lubricating the passages, thus making the passage of the child more
easy.&mdash;(See Plate <a href="#Page_65">XII</a>.)</p>

<p>The other two membranes, the Chorion and Decidua, are not of much
importance in our present explanation; and practically, in fact, the
whole three may be regarded as <em>one envelope</em>, surrounding the
child and the waters in which it floats.</p>


<h5>THE PLACENTA.</h5>

<p>At the full term the Placenta, (See Plate <a
href="#Page_65">XII</a>,) is about six or seven inches in diameter, and
nearly circular, though often irregular. Its thickness varies from one
to two inches, and is greatest where the cord is inserted. Sometimes it
is very large, or very thick, and may then be difficult to extract, and
even cause serious accidents.</p>

<p>As already explained the Placenta is composed of a mass of
blood-vessels, by means of which the blood of the fœtus is, in
some way, brought into contact, or commingled with that of the
mother. Its uterine face is irregular, being broken into lobes,
or cotyledons, on which may be seen a vast number of little veins
and arteries, corresponding with others on the inner surface of
the Womb. Its outer surface is of a grey red color, and covered
with the fœtal membranes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157"
id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> under which the large blood-vessels can
be traced. The Placenta is usually attached to one side of the Uterus,
near the fundus, or at the fundus, but sometimes it grows wholly, or in
part, over the mouth of the Womb; an occurrence which may cause serious
consequences.</p>

<p>When there is more than one child each usually has a separate
placenta, and they are all intimately connected. In some rare cases
however, one placenta only exists with twins. Each child has also a
separate amnion, and waters; but there may be only one chorion and
decidua for the whole, or each may have a complete set of membranes
itself. Instances have been known however, of two children being
enclosed in the same amnion, and surrounded by the same waters, having
but one placenta between them.</p>

<p>These possible diversities show the accoucheur how necessary it is
for him, in any case of multiple pregnancy, to be sure that he has
abstracted <em>all</em> the after birth; and they also caution him not
to proceed to unnecessary manipulations merely because it is not the
same as in other cases.</p>


<h5>THE UMBILICAL CORD.</h5>

<p>This is composed, as already stated, of an artery and two veins,
which twist round the artery, like the strands of a rope. These are
all enclosed in a sheath, and surrounded by a thick kind of mucus,
called the <em>Gelatine of Wharton</em>. Its thickness is about that
of the little finger, though it may be much larger, having been seen
as thick as the child's body. Its usual length is about eighteen or
twenty inches, but it has measured as much as five feet. Then again it
has been found so small that the vessels in it<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> could not nourish the
child. These exceptional variations however, are very rare. The veins
may also be enlarged, or full of knots, and the circulation may be
so much impeded thereby as to cause abortion. The various accidents
which may result from anomalies in the cord will however, engage our
attention in another place.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<p class="center ph5">PRESENTATIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE FŒTUS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> child may present several different
parts of its body, at the commencement of delivery, and they may be in
different positions relatively to the different parts of the Pelvis.
All these require to be known.</p>

<p>Different authors have made different classifications of the
presentations and positions, and have differently named them; but this
is of little consequence, since they are still the same, no matter how
they are named. I shall follow the arrangement of M. Chailly, because I
think it equally perfect, and much more simple and practical, than any
other yet proposed.</p>


<h5>PRESENTATIONS.</h5>

<p>The fœtus may present at the mouth of the Womb either by the
<em>head</em>, the most usual way&mdash;by the lower extremities, which
is the most frequent way after the head&mdash;or by various parts of
the trunk, which is the least frequent way of all.</p>

<p>In each of these <em>three</em> full presentations there may
be certain variations, which require to be noticed. The head, for
instance, may present either by the <em>cranium</em> or by the
<em>face</em>; the lower part of the body may present either by the
<em>feet</em>, the <em>knees</em>, or the <em>breech</em>, according as
the legs and thighs are flexed or extended; and the trunk may present
either on the <em>right</em> or <em>left</em> side, and inclined
towards the <em>back</em> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> towards the <em>chest</em>, though
neither the back nor abdomen ever fully present.</p>

<p>Each of these variations may also have slight variations again. Thus
the face may present full, or by one or the other cheek, and so on.
These variations however, are of little practical consequence, because
we only find them at the very commencement of the labor, and they
always change to the full presentation.</p>

<p>Practically speaking therefore, there are <em>five full
presentations</em>, viz., <em>the Cranium</em>, <em>the Face</em>,
<em>the Breech</em>, <em>the Feet</em>, or knees, and the
<em>Trunk</em>, either by the right or left side.</p>

<p>The <em>varieties</em> of these, as already remarked, not requiring
any special attention from the accoucheur, providing he is not puzzled
or misled by them.</p>


<h5>POSITIONS.</h5>

<p>The position means the particular direction in which the presenting
part of the Fœtus is placed in relation to the Pelvic straits. The
Pelvis itself is supposed to be divided into two similar halves, the
<em>right</em> and the <em>left</em>, and each presenting part has
one particular place which is referred to as the indicating point.
Thus, for instance, in the Cranium the Occipit, or behind part of
the head, is the indicating point; and we therefore say, in Cranium
presentations, that it is a <em>right or left Occipital position</em>,
according as the back of the head is to the right or left side of
the Pelvis. In face presentations, the chin (<em>mentor</em>) is the
indicating point, and we therefore say it is a <em>right or left mento
position</em>, according as the chin is towards the right or left side.
In breech presentations, the child's sacrum is the indicating<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
point, and we then say it is a <em>right or left sacral position</em>,
according as the Sacrum is towards the right or left side of the
Pelvis. In trunk presentations, which are always crosswise, the head
(cephalo) is the indicating point, and we therefore say it is a
<em>right or left cephalo position</em>, according as the head lies
towards the right or left side of the mother's body.</p>

<p>In Cranium presentations also, the back of the head is not merely
on the right or left side, but may be at two different points on each
side. It may be either nearest to the Sacrum (posterior), or nearest
to the pubes (anterior), but still against the Ilium; it is therefore
called a <em>right or left anterior</em>, <em>or posterior</em>,
<em>occipito iliac position</em>, as the case may be. Sometimes also,
the occiput lodges immediately on the pubis, instead of going to either
side, and that is called an <em>occipito pubic position</em>; at other
times, on the contrary, it is placed against the Sacrum, instead
of being on either side, and that is called an <em>occipito sacral
position</em>.</p>

<p>In presentations of the head therefore, we may reckon <em>six</em>
positions&mdash;the right and left anterior and posterior occipito
iliac, and the pubic and sacral.</p>

<p>In presentations of the face the same; they being <em>mento</em>
iliac and so on, instead of occipito.</p>

<p>In presentations of the lower extremities also the same, excepting
that they are <em>sacro</em> iliac and so on, instead of occipito.</p>

<p>In presentations of the trunk we have but two positions for each
side, the right and left cephalo iliac; according as the head is on the
right or left side of the mother's body. The child always lying, in
presentations of the trunk, crosswise&mdash;the feet on one side and
the head on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Most authors enumerate many more presentations and positions, but
they are of little practical utility. When the head presents, for
instance, the delivery takes place in nearly the same manner, let it be
in what position it may. And in presentations of the face, or of the
lower extremities, the particular position is of little consequence,
the delivery being usually effected much the same in them all. Some of
the positions are, it is true, much more favorable than others, but a
spontaneous delivery, generally speaking, occurs in all of them, when
the head, face, or lower extremities presents. Very frequently indeed,
the less favorable positions are changed to the more favorable ones,
and the worst seldom do more than impede delivery for a time, unless
there be some malformation, or loss of power. I therefore refer to them
more for convenience in future explanations, and to enable my readers
to know what is meant by them, when they read other books; not because
they are really necessary to be understood, or of any great practical
use.</p>

<p>The celebrated Baudelocque admitted <em>seventy-four positions</em>,
and <em>twenty-two presentations</em>; and the number might be made
still greater, if all the variations were to be enumerated. Such
classifications however, are more ingenious than useful, and they are
but little noticed even by medical men.</p>

<p>I shall merely describe the mechanism of labor in the most frequent
positions, in each presentation, because the others usually change
into these; and even when they do not, the process of delivery is
essentially the same, and also the mode of assisting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>


<h5>MODE OF ASCERTAINING THE PRESENTATION AND POSITION.</h5>

<p><i>The Presentation.</i>&mdash;Although in general it is not possible
to ascertain with certainty, what part of the fœtus presents to the
mouth of the Womb, until labor commences, yet a tolerable judgment
can frequently be formed before. In head presentations, on performing
ballotment, the head is felt, like a firm round tumor, occupying all
the space which the finger can reach, very differently from any other
part. The peculiar cramps in the female's lower limbs, and frequent
inclination to urinate, mentioned in the signs of labor, are also
strong indications of this presentation, being seldom experienced in
any other. When the labor has actually commenced there can be but
little uncertainty in these cases, for, immediately the mouth of the
Womb is sufficiently open, the finger can be introduced, and the head
felt like a smooth, round, and elastic bony tumor, not likely to be
mistaken for anything else, if ordinary care be taken. After the waters
have escaped, it can of course be felt still more distinctly. If even
an inexperienced person bears in mind the <em>shape</em> of the head,
and reflects how it must <em>fill up</em> the passage, and how it
must feel, from being composed of separated thin bony plates, lying
on a soft yielding substance like the brain, he can scarcely fail to
recognize it. The sensation is very much like that of pressing a piece
of firm card board on an inflated bladder, which forms a tolerable
representative of the fœtal head. Sometimes there is a difficulty
from a great quantity of water being intruded between the membranes
and the head, which somewhat obscures the touch, but this only
necessitates greater care. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165"
id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> water however, may be in such quantity
as to entirely prevent the touch, in which case nothing can be done
till the membranes break; the presentation can then be ascertained with
certainty, and it will be quite early enough to render assistance,
if it should be an unfavorable one. I have known some inexperienced
persons mistake the bag of water itself for the head, and commit great
errors in consequence.</p>

<p>The Face can seldom be mistaken, because the nose, or mouth, may
be felt; and, by passing the finger up the side of the head, the ears
also.</p>

<p>The trunk is in general easy of recognition. Nearly always the right
or left shoulder occupies the passage, or is near to it, so that the
finger may be readily passed under the arm pit. The shoulder joints,
the ribs, or the shoulder blade bone, all feel very different to the
head, and are not likely to be taken for it.</p>

<p>In presentations of the lower extremities there is still less
danger of error. If the feet, or knees, occupy the passage, they can
scarcely be mistaken. The breech is certainly something like the head
in its form, but feels different, and is divided down the middle by
the indentation between the two cheeks, along which the finger can be
passed till it enters between the limbs.</p>

<p>In irregular presentations, as of the arms for instance, or of one
leg, or an arm and leg, it is only necessary to carefully feel them,
so as to ascertain their form, and the relation of their parts. Thus
the fingers can be distinguished from the toes, and the feet from the
hands, particularly if the ankle can be felt.</p>

<p>The accoucheur should ascertain the particular presentation <em>as
early as possible</em>, because he may<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> sometimes be of service
in correcting an unfavorable one, if he is certain of it in time, and
knows what he is about. He should not however, use any degree of force
to ascertain it, in case he cannot do so without, but wait till the
conditions are more favorable. Neither should he, with the same object,
rupture the membranes too soon, for he may thereby cause considerable
delay and difficulty, without any good to counterbalance it.</p>

<p>All the above-named presentations may, and usually do, terminate
spontaneously, except those of the trunk, and even they do
occasionally, though more frequently they require assistance.</p>

<p><i>Relative frequency of the different presentations.</i>&mdash;The
most favorable presentations, and positions also, are always the most
frequent, while the unfavorable ones are but seldom met with. According
to Madame Lachapelle, in <em>fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty-two
labors</em> there are about <em>fourteen thousand seven hundred and
forty-nine</em> presentations of the head and face; about <em>five
hundred and eighty-six</em> of the breech, knees, and feet; and only
about <em>sixty-eight</em> of the trunk, or shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Positions.</i>&mdash;The position is generally of but little
consequence, because in all the favorable presentations spontaneous
delivery occurs in every position alike, and in the unfavorable
presentations the same assistance is required in one position as in
another. In some cases an unfavorable position of the head may be
changed however, to a better one; and therefore, so far as the head is
concerned, the positions are worth ascertaining.</p>

<p>The mode of determining the position is by feeling for the
<em>sutures</em> and <em>fontanelles</em>, described in Chapter VIII;
and this cannot be usually done till after the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> membranes are broken,
when the head can be distinctly touched. By referring to Plate XXIV,
the shape and position of the Fontanelles will be seen, and if the head
be supposed placed with the top downwards, and the back of it to the
mother's left side, they may be readily found with the finger.</p>

<p>In the left anterior occipito iliac position, or that when the back
of the child's head is against the left side of the mother's pelvis,
and nearest the pubes, while its forehead is against the right side,
and nearest the sacrum,&mdash;the sagittal suture, or opening along
the top, will of course run across from right to left. This opening
may be distinctly felt with the finger, which should be passed along
it towards the right side, and it will then reach the <em>anterior
fontanelle</em>; afterwards it should also be passed to the left
side, and then it will reach the <em>posterior fontanelle</em>. The
difference between these two openings, in shape and size, is shown in
Plate XXIV, and even if a person has never seen, or felt, the head
of a newborn child, they can scarcely be taken for each other, after
noticing that Plate.</p>

<p>If the anterior fontanelle should be felt on the left side instead
of the right, and near the pubes, while the posterior fontanelles is
to the right, and near the sacrum, the position must be the <em>right
posterior occipito iliac</em>, or just the reverse of the former.</p>

<p>If the sagittal suture should be found to run across from the
pubes to the sacrum, instead of from one side to the other, it will
then indicate either an occipito pubic, or occipito sacral position,
according as the back of the head is behind or before; and this can be
readily ascertained by finding either of the fontanelles.</p>

<p>In short, if the relative position, forms, and directions<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> of
these openings in the child's head be clearly understood, the position
of the head can nearly always be determined by feeling them, as will be
evident by referring to our former explanation of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes however, the bones overlap a good deal, from the
head being pressed, and then instead of an opening along the top,
a <em>seam</em> will be felt. And sometimes, from long continued
pressure, a quantity of blood, and watery fluid, will be effused under
the scalp, so as to prevent the bone being distinctly touched. But
these accidents seldom happen, and with ordinary care and perseverance,
need not prevent the position being determined, after a little
delay.</p>

<p>The position of other presenting parts is easily ascertained, by
feeling for some known point&mdash;as the <em>nose</em>, or the face,
the depression between the cheeks, or the breech, and so on.</p>

<p><i>Relative frequency of the different positions.</i>&mdash;The most
favorable positions, like the most favorable presentations, are also
the most frequent. According to Baudelocque, in <em>ten thousand
three hundred and twenty-two cases</em>, of head presentation, there
were <em>eight thousand five hundred and twenty-two</em> cases when
the back of the child's head was on the mother's left side, and
towards the front, (or in the left anterior occipito iliac position);
<em>one thousand seven hundred and fifty-four</em> when it was on
the <em>right</em> side towards the front, (right anterior occipito
iliac); <em>twenty-five times</em> to the right side, but towards the
Sacrum, (right posterior occipito iliac); and <em>nineteen times</em>
on the left, but towards the Sacrum, (left posterior occipito iliac.)
Being most frequently with the back of the head <em>towards the
front on the left side</em>, as shown in Plate XXVII; next towards
the front on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> side; and but seldom towards the
Sacrum, or back, on either side. In all these ten thousand cases we do
not find a single instance of the head lying from back to front, in
the <em>occipito pubic</em>, or <em>occipito sacral</em> positions,
commonly called transverse; neither do we find a single instance in
<em>fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty-two cases</em> recorded by
Madame Lachapelle; which will show how rare such unfortunate positions
must be. What this great frequency of one particular position depends
upon we do not know&mdash;possibly on that cause, previously alluded
to, which determines the most frequent presentation.</p>

<p>In the next Chapter, the mechanism of delivery, or the manner in
which the child escapes out of the body, as it most frequently occurs,
will be fully explained.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

<h5>THE MECHANISM OF DELIVERY, IN A PRESENTATION OF THE HEAD.</h5>


<h5>THE LEFT ANTERIOR OCCIPITO ILIAC POSITION.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the presentation and position
most frequently observed, perhaps fifteen out of sixteen times. In most
Obstetrical works it is called the <em>first</em> position.</p>

<p>By observing the following Plates, and referring to the previous
explanations of the diameters of the Pelvis, and fœtal head, in Plates
IX and XXV, it will be seen that through all its changes of position,
while making its exit, the head always presents by one of its shortest
diameters to one of the largest diameters of the Pelvis, so that the
relation between them is invariably the best that could be established;
and many peculiar turnings and revolutions occur, apparently for the
express purpose of bringing this about.</p>

<p>Before the rupture of the membranes the head presents its occipito
frontal diameter, which measures four inches, to the right oblique
diameter of the Pelvis, which measures four inches and a half; while
its bi-parietal diameter, which measures only about three inches and a
half, is presented to the other oblique diameter, also measuring four
and a half&mdash;(See Plate <a href="#Page_120">XIX</a>.) Even here
it will be seen that the passage is larger than the head which has to
pass through it, but a more favorable position still can be obtained,
by a slight movement of the Fœtus, which<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> nature accordingly
accomplishes, and also follows by others, to preserve the advantage,
which will next be described.</p>

<p><i>Movements of the Fœtal Head.</i>&mdash;There are three of these
peculiar movements, each of which takes place at a particular period of
the labor, and must be described separately.</p>

<p><i>First movement, flexion, and descent.</i>&mdash;Immediately after
the Membranes are broken, the contractions of the Uterus force the
head into the upper strait, by the occipito frontal diameter of four
inches, as already shown; but then commences the first movement, which
consists in a bending of the child's chin down upon its breast, so that
the forehead is carried up into the Womb; and the most prominent point
of the back of the head presents to the middle of the passage, by the
<em>occipito bregmatic</em> diameter, which is only about <em>three
inches</em> instead of four. This of course makes the passage so much
easier, and generally, immediately after this change, the head descends
into the basin of the Pelvis.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely necessary however, for this movement to occur,
for in a well formed Pelvis the head can descend without it, though not
so easily; and sometimes, in fact, it does not take place, but this is
unusual.</p>

<p>It must be recollected that this shifting of the head alters the
position of the <em>fontanelles</em>&mdash;the posterior one being
brought more to the centre of the strait, and the anterior one carried
up out of reach, while previous to the movement they were both on a
level. If an examination is not made therefore, till after this change,
it may be difficult to determine the position, unless this is borne in
mind. The following Plates show this very well.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">At this time the anterior fontanelle can
scarcely be reached, but the posterior one is easily to be reached,
being in the open passage, on the left side. The head is now fairly
within the Pelvic cavity, but still lies across from right to left.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><i>Second Movement, Rotation of the
Head.</i>&mdash;When the Fœtus is thus brought to the bottom of the
Pelvis, its head turns completely round, the back of it being brought
to the front, or under the pubes of the mother, and its forehead turned
against her Sacrum, as represented in Plate XXIX.</p>

so that the two fontanelles are again found on the same level. Finally
the back of the head fully emerges from under the pubic arch, and the
chin slides gradually out after it beneath, so that the neck of the
child is encircled by the ring of the Vulva.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="caption">

    <p>In <i>Fig. 1</i>, the back of the head is nearly under the pubic bone,
while the forehead is just passing the external opening below.</p>

    <p>In <i>Fig. 2</i>, the back of the head is completely extruded, and also
the chin, so that the whole head is now born.&mdash;(<i>p.</i> is the pubic
bone, in front.)</p>

  </div>

</div>

<p>In Fig. 1 it will be seen how the Os Coccygis, or lowest part of the
back bone, (c,) is straitened out, backward, while the head is passing,
as I explained before; and in Fig. 2 it has returned again to its
natural position.</p>

<p>The reason for this rotation of the head will be obvious on calling
to mind the form of the Pelvis and the external opening. On examining
Plates IX and X, it will be seen that the longest diameter of the
Vulva, or external opening, the <em>antero posterior</em>, is nearly
at right angles to the longest diameters of the upper strait, the
<em>oblique</em>. Now the longest diameter of the head is adapted
to this oblique diameter, on <em>entering</em> the upper strait, as
already explained, and it is necessary for it also to be adapted to
the longest diameter of the external opening, the anterior posterior
when making its <em>exit</em>; but as the two are not parallel the
head is compelled to turn, or rotate, in order to pass from one to
the other. To accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> this however, the neck has to be
twisted considerably. But when the head is fully delivered, it is
immediately straitened again, by the back of the head turning towards
the mother's left side, so that its proper relations with the trunk is
re-established.</p>

<p><i>Third Movement, Rotation of the Shoulders.</i>&mdash;When the head is
delivered the shoulders come next, which also require to turn round a
little, to adjust themselves to the long diameter of the lower strait;
and as they turn within the Pelvis the head also turns, to correspond,
and thus the back of it is brought opposite the middle of the mother's
left thigh. Immediately this movement is effected, the shoulders
rapidly escape through the external opening, the right one being in
front, a little to the left of the symphysis pubes, and the left one
behind, a little to the right of the os coccygis. The body then curves
upwards, to accommodate itself to the curved axis of the Pelvis, and
speedily follows the shoulders.</p>

<p>These curious movements cause the child to pass in a spiral
direction, so that each part may pass through the Pelvis in the most
favorable position. Sometimes all these movements are not effected,
and yet the delivery may occur, though not so speedily, or safely,
as when they are. The shoulders do not always fully rotate, but may
nevertheless pass the opening, if the parts be large, and well relaxed.
It is questionable however, if the head can ever pass the lower strait
without rotating, when it enters the Pelvis diagonally, the occipit on
one side and the forehead on the other; as it is necessary for either
one or the other of these parts to pass under the pubes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185"
id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>


<h5>MECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN ALL OTHER POSITIONS OF THE HEAD.</h5>

<p><i>The right posterior occipital position.</i>&mdash;This position,
called the <em>second</em> by some authors, and the <em>fourth</em>
by others, is exactly the reverse of the one just described, the head
lying in the same direction, but the back of it being behind, to the
right of the Sacrum, and the forehead to the left of the pubes.</p>

<p>Precisely the same movements are gone through in this position as in
the other, excepting that the head has to rotate considerably further.
In the former position the back of the head is only a <em>little</em>
to the left of the pubis, and therefore has not far to turn to pass
under it; but in this position the back of the head is <em>behind</em>,
and therefore has to turn very far round to reach the same position.
The rotation is therefore more difficult, not so soon effected, and
sometimes likely to be dangerous to the child.</p>

<p>In the other movements there are no difference worthy of notice,
but it must be borne in mind that they all occur the reverse way, to
what they do in the first position, because the occiput is on the
<em>right</em> side instead of the left.</p>

<p><i>The right anterior occipital position.</i>&mdash;This position is
precisely the same as the first, but on the other side. The back of the
head is in front, but to the <em>right</em> of the pubis instead of the
left, while the forehead is behind, to the left of the Sacrum. This
will be apparent enough by observing Plate XXXI.</p>

<p>The mechanism of delivery is precisely the same, and all the
movements occur in the same order and manner, as in the first position,
but the reverse way. The rotation, for instance, being from right to
left, instead of from left to right, and so of all the others.</p>

<p><i>The left posterior occipital position.</i>&mdash;Delivery is effected
the same in this as in the left anterior, or first position, excepting
that the rotation is more extended, owing to the occiput being behind,
as explained in the right posterior occipital position.</p>


<h5>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE HEAD.</h5>

<p>In all the other positions, and their varieties, there is nothing
that calls for special notice, or that is material in practice, the
delivery being nearly the same in them all. No matter what position the
head is placed in, the back of it nearly <em>always</em> comes to the
front, under the pubes, even though it have to turn half round to do
so. The cause of this is supposed to be the peculiar form of the parts,
which give it a screw like motion, in its descent, and the shape of
the external opening, which, being longest from before to behind, can
only allow the long diameter of the head to pass through in the same
direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, the occiput passes behind, instead of coming
to the front, and then the <em>chin</em> comes under the pubes, while
the occiput presses on the coccygis. This is very seldom observed, and
when it occurs the labor is more difficult and tedious, though it may
still terminate spontaneously.</p>

<p>The resistance of the soft parts, externally, appears to be the
chief cause of the head turning; for when they are much relaxed, and
the child's head small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190"
id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> it will sometimes pass without, or
in the anterior posterior position. And sometimes, when the head is
large, so that it distends the parts very much, the shoulders will pass
cross wise, there being room enough for them without turning. In some
females, formed large, whose organs are excessively relaxed, and whose
children are small, the delivery takes place without <em>any</em> of
the movements being effected, the child passing straight through in
whatever position it may happen to be: this is rarely seen however.</p>

<p>When there are twins they do not usually both present by the head,
but one by the feet; and frequently the parts are so relaxed by the
passage of the first, that the second is delivered without rotating
at all, though in general it follows precisely the same movements. It
sometimes happens however, that the second birth does not take place
till some hours, or even days, after the first.</p>

<p>It may be said, in general, that all positions of the head are
favorable to both mother and child, and may terminate spontaneously. It
is seldom that anything more than ordinary assistance is required in
any of them, and they could in general terminate without any at all,
though sometimes with difficulty. The worst cases are those in which
the head does not turn round, but remains across, or where the back
of it turns behind, instead of coming to the front. In these cases
there is great danger of the perineum, or external lips, being much
lacerated, or even of an artificial passage being torn through the
perineum, leading to the most serious after results. About one child
also, out of every fifty, is lost in these unfavorable positions.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII.</h4>

<h5>MECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE LOWER
EXTREMITIES.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> presentation includes the feet, the
knees, the breech, and also the hips, there being no difference in the
delivery for all these parts. It is the same also whether there be one
foot, or knee, or both feet and knees.</p>

<p>There are but two positions worthy of notice in this presentation,
and they are determined by the child's sacrum. If the sacrum, or
posteriors, are to the right of the mother's Pelvis, it is called the
<em>right sacro iliac position</em>; but if they are on the left side
it is called the <em>left sacro iliac position</em>. The direction in
which the child's pelvis is placed, is analagous to that of the head,
the sacrum answering to the occiput. Thus most frequently the sacrum
is on the left side, a little to the left of the pubes, (<em>left
anterior</em>) while the abdomen faces the right side near the sacrum.
When on the right side however, it is most usually nearest the sacrum,
with the abdomen facing the left side near the pubes.</p>

<p>The lower extremities present most frequently next after the
head, but still they are but seldom met with. M. P. Dubois tells
us that out of <em>twenty thousand labors</em> he only met with
<em>eighty-five</em> such cases. In these eighty-five cases the breech
presented <em>fifty-four</em> times, and the feet <em>twenty-six</em>,
the knees being found <em>but once</em>.</p>

<p>A presentation of the lower extremities may generally be recognized
at an early stage, by the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> being felt at the <em>fundus</em> of the
Uterus, and by the pulsations of the fœtal heart being heard above the
umbilicus, as explained in the section on Auscultation. After labor has
commenced the part felt at the mouth of the Womb is irregular, and so
different from the head, that it is not likely to be mistaken for it.
If the knees or feet present, they can always be distinguished; and
if the breech presents it can easily be recognized by its form, and
particularly by the os coccygis, which can be distinctly felt at the
bottom of the depression between the two cheeks. The side on which it
is felt of course determines the position, and the same with the front
of the knees, or the heels. The Rectum can also be reached with the
finger, when the breech is touched; but great care must be taken not
to intrude it too far, because with a female child the <em>Vulva</em>
might be mistaken for it, and thus the hymen be broken, and other
injury committed. The genitals of a male child are more obvious, so
that the sex of the child may be usually ascertained, along with the
position.</p>

<p>For want of proper care the breech has been mistaken for the head,
and face, but this can scarcely happen if the accoucheur is attentive.
It is simply necessary to call to mind what <em>must</em> be felt
in each presentation, as the <em>nose</em> and <em>mouth</em> with
the face; the two cheeks of the posteriors, with the opening between
them; and also the genitals, with the breech; and it can be certainly
ascertained which of these parts are really at the opening. With the
knees or feet there can scarcely be a doubt.</p>


<h5>DELIVERY IN A BREECH PRESENTATION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR SACRO-ILIAC
POSITION.</h5>

<p>In this position the legs and thighs are turned up<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
against the abdomen, the breech in full occupying the passage, with the
sacrum to the left and in front of the mother's pelvis.</p>

<p>The descent of the breech usually takes place without much
difficulty, into the Pelvis, it being small and easily compressed. It
descends in the same direction in which it first presents&mdash;that is
diagonally, like the head&mdash;and also rotates, or turns round, so
that the left buttock comes in front, just to the right of the pubis,
while the right one goes behind, to the left of the sacrum. The left
buttock reaches the mouth of the Vulva first, in this position, and
then remains stationary there while the right one slides along the
curve of the sacrum and perineum, and passes out first at the lower
part of the external opening. The left however, speedily follows,
and when the whole breech is born it rotates again, one hip coming
immediately in front, and the other going immediately behind. Owing
to this movement the long diameter of the breech is adapted to the
long diameter of the Pelvis, as in the case of the head. This will be
evident from the following Plate:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194"

<i>c.</i> The Coccygis, much straightened.<br />
<i>p.</i> The pubic bone, in front.<br />
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<p>The rest of the body then rotates in the same way, and the arms
and shoulders pass through the external opening in the same direction
as the hips. The left shoulder first moves to the right of the pubes,
while the left passes behind; and then, just when they are both passing
out, one comes immediately in front, and the other immediately behind,
placing themselves in the long diameter of the Vulva.</p>

<p>The head passes through the superior strait in the left, anterior
occipital position, and is often delivered in that way; but sometimes
it rotates, and the forehead passes into the curve of the sacrum,
while the occiput is placed behind the pubes. When this occurs<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> the
body also rotates, to accompany the head. This state of the parts is
represented in the following Plate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="plate-inline">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="center">PLATE XXXIII.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 234px;">

    <p class="noindent">
<i>c.</i> The Coccygis.<br />
<i>p.</i> The pubic bone, in front.<br />
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<p>At this period the head is passed the uterus, and there is therefore
little or no contraction to expel it, so that it often remains a
long time undelivered. It will be seen that the position is very
unfavorable, the longest diameter of the head, the occipito frontal,
being the presenting one, which makes it lie immoveably across. The
means of assisting in such a case are plain enough, the forehead
must be brought down while the body is <em>raised</em>, towards the
mother's abdomen; this will throw the top of the head back, towards the
sacrum, and change the presenting diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> The forehead and bregma
rapidly escape below, and the occiput passes out last. This is the way
in which nature herself also completes the delivery in such cases, when
she has the power.</p>


<h5>DELIVERY BY THE BREECH IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR SACRO ILIAC
POSITION.</h5>

<p>This position is the reverse of the preceding one, the Sacrum being
behind, and to the right, while the Abdomen is to the left in front.
The same movements are performed as in the first position, and the
whole process is similar, only the reverse way. The Sacrum being behind
however, has to rotate much further to come in front, precisely the
same as with the head when in the posterior position.</p>

<p>The head generally follows the Sacrum, and the occiput comes under
the pubes, as already explained; but sometimes only at the moment when
being disengaged.</p>


<h5>DELIVERY BY THE BREECH IN THE FULL POSTERIOR, OR SACRO SACRAL
POSITION.</h5>

<p>In this position there is no rotation at all, the back of the child
being turned full to the back of the mother, and the whole body,
and head, being expelled in that position. In general there is no
particular difficulty from this position, but on the contrary it is
thought by some to be rather favorable than otherwise. The longest
diameter of the fœtal pelvis, and shoulders, are adapted to the longest
diameter of the mother's pelvis, at the upper strait, and easily pass
it. They will also generally pass the external opening in the same
direction, unless it be very unyielding,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> or the child very large;
and if they pass the head usually follows, because the parts have been
so much dilated by the passage of the body that they offer but little
resistance.</p>


<h5>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.</h5>

<p>As a general rule delivery by the breech, or by any other position
of the lower extremities, is less favorable than by the head. The labor
is usually longer, more painful, and more exhausting; still however, it
is generally spontaneous, and not necessarily dangerous to the mother.
To the child, on the contrary, it is dangerous, on many accounts.</p>

<p>It appears, from the observations of M. P. Dubois, that in this
presentation <em>one child is lost out of every twelve</em>, while only
one out of <em>fifty</em> is lost in head presentations! The chief
cause for this greater mortality appears to be <em>the compression
of the umbilical cord</em>, which is greater, and lasts much longer,
than when the head presents, as will be evident on examining the
circumstances under which delivery is effected in each case. When the
head presents it passes, and also the shoulders, before the umbilicus
is reached; the mother's organs are therefore much dilated, and only
the smallest parts of the fœtus are left, when the cord is engaged in
the passage; it cannot therefore be much compressed, nor for any long
time, because the labor is then soon over. When the lower extremities
present this is not the case, the <em>smallest</em> parts then pass
before the umbilicus is reached, so that the cord has to pass along
with the head and shoulders, which are both the largest and the longest
in being delivered. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> compression of the cord stops the
circulation of blood between the fœtus and the Placenta, as will be
evident on referring to the description formerly given of <em>Fœtal
nutrition</em>; and the stopping of this circulation is as fatal, to
it, as stopping the breath is to an adult. When the breech presents
altogether, there is not so much danger as with the feet, or knees,
because it is large, and in its passage dilates the parts so much that
the rest of the body, and the head, follow more quickly. There is, of
course, no danger till after the hips have passed, because the cord is
not reached before; but the delivery should be completed as soon after
they are born as possible, for every minute's delay makes the chances
for the child's life so much less.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIII.</h4>

<h5>MECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE FACE.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">Presentations</span> of the face appear to
result from the head being bent backwards, instead of forwards upon
the chest. They are easily recognized, because the face has so many
peculiar parts, as the nose and mouth, for instance, which are
altogether unlike what can be felt in any other presentation. In a very
early stage the forehead may be taken for the vortex, unless care be
used, because it <em>feels</em> round and soft like it, but the mistake
cannot last long.</p>

<p>The positions in this presentation, as formerly explained, are
determined by the chin, and in practice only two are noticed&mdash;the
<em>right posterior mento iliac</em>, and the <em>left anterior mento
iliac</em>. In the first the chin is on the right side, near the
sacrum, and in the second it is on the left side, near the pubes. These
answer, it will be seen, to the two principal positions of the head
itself. It is generally considered that, though the chin, like the
head, may assume other positions, yet it does so in but very few cases,
and these presenting no peculiarities which require special notice.</p>


<h5>DELIVERY IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR MENTO ILIAC POSITION OF THE
FACE.</h5>

<p>The head descends with the forehead and chin nearly on a level, and
the nose occupying the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200"
id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> of the passage. When fairly in the
cavity it rotates, the chin being brought under the pubes, while the
back of the head passes into the curve of the sacrum. This is nearly
always the process; no matter where the chin may be when the labor
commences, it seldom fails to move under the pubes before it concludes.
Occasionally it may rotate the other way, and pass into the hollow of
the sacrum, while the occiput comes in front, but this is very rare.</p>

<p>The chin is born first, and then follows, below, the forehead, top
of the head, and finally the occiput&mdash;the face turning upwards
towards the mother's abdomen, as each part is successively delivered.
When the head is fully born, the body rotates inside the same as in the
head presentation, and the delivery concludes in precisely the same
way.</p>

  </div>

</div>


<h5>DELIVERY IN OTHER POSITIONS OF THE FACE.</h5>

<p>The delivery is precisely the same in all the other positions of
the face, excepting that in some of them<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> the chin has further to
rotate before it can pass under the pubes. In all cases however, it
may be safely calculated that it will do so, there having been so few
instances known in which it has rotated the other way, into the hollow
of the sacrum, which is fortunate, for there is always more or less
difficulty and danger when it does so.</p>

<p>Sometimes the rotation does not take place at all, but the face
descends diagonally, as the head occasionally does.</p>

<p>On the whole presentations of the face are not particularly to
be feared, as regards the mother. Some authors even consider them
quite favorable, and reckon them only as varieties of the head
presentation. Madame Lachapelle states as a principle, that face
presentations should always be left to nature. And M. Chailly says he
must admit that, in all positions of the face, the labor may terminate
spontaneously, excepting when the chin passes behind, in which case
it will be protracted, and most likely fatal to the child. The labor
is generally a little longer, and more painful, owing to the face not
being so perfectly adapted to the passage as the head is; but still
it must be regarded as favorable to the mother, though assistance is
oftener required than with the head. There is more or less danger to
the child however, owing to the head being kept under pressure for
an unusual time, which produces congestion. The neck is also forced
against the pubic bone, as will be seen by Figs. 1 and 2, Plate XXXIV,
and thus the jugular veins are compressed. If there be any delay, it
is customary to observe the face closely, after the chin is born; and
if it appears from any indications that congestion is taking place,
assistance is rendered at once. The face will sometimes become<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> so
tumefied, and engorged with blood, from this prolonged pressure, that
it will not appear natural till several days after birth.</p>

<p>Probably about one child is lost in ten or twelve deliveries
in these cases; and if the chin pass behind its death is almost
certain.</p>

<p>It was formerly the practice to endeavor to turn the face upwards,
when at the superior strait, and so change the presentation to one
of the head. This however, is now abandoned, because the attempt is
seldom successful, and does not materially improve the condition of
things, besides being painful to the mother. The only extra danger
with the face presenting is to the child, and this is not removed by
the operation; to the mother the face is nearly as favorable as the
cranium. In regard to the frequency of face presentations, we find
that Madame Lachapelle met with but <em>seventy-two</em> cases in
<em>fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty-two deliveries</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>


<h4>CHAPTER XIV.</h4>

<h5>MECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE TRUNK.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has already been stated that in
presentations of the Trunk it is nearly always the right or left
shoulder which occupies the passage. It is stated, by some authors,
that they have felt the back, and abdomen, but others think they were
mistaken; and most certainly such positions are extremely rare, if they
actually do ever exist.</p>

<p>There are two presentations of the Trunk, determined by the side on
which the fœtus lies, and denominated accordingly <em>right</em> or
<em>left lateral presentations</em>.</p>

<p>Each of these presentations has two corresponding positions,
determined by the side on which the child's head lies. If the head be
on the mother's right side it is called the <em>right cephalo iliac
position</em>, and if it be on the left side it is denominated the
<em>left cephalo iliac position</em>. The mechanism of spontaneous
delivery is the same in them both, and in all their varieties, and so
is the mode of rendering assistance, so that a description of one will
suffice.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the labor has lasted long without assistance, one
arm will be forced down first, and even appear externally. This used to
be considered a separate presentation, and described as such, under the
name of <em>presentation of the hand and arm</em>. There is no reason
for describing it separately however, and no utility in doing so, as it
differs in no essential particular from ordinary presentation of the
shoulders, and must receive the same assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>What it is that produces presentations of the Trunk, and other
unfavorable parts, is not known, though they are generally thought
to be owing to excessive motion in the child, or obliquities of the
Womb.</p>

<p>M. Lachapelle met with <em>sixty-eight</em> cases of Trunk
presentation in <em>fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty-two
labors</em>, which is nearly the same as the face. The right side
presents more frequently than the left, and the head is on the
left side oftener than on the right, as it is in ordinary head
presentations.</p>

<p>As a general rule assistance is always rendered in presentations
of the Trunk, and is generally considered absolutely necessary. It is
undoubtedly true however, that nature has effected delivery in such
cases unaided, though rarely, and such instances are considered as
extremely fortunate exceptions to the general rule. M. Chailly says
that the accoucheur should never leave such cases to nature alone,
but always aid her; but other authors trust to her a little more. The
most usual mode of rendering assistance is to <em>turn the child</em>,
and bring down the feet, a manœuvre which will be fully described
hereafter.</p>

<p>In some cases the child turns itself, from the contractions of the
Womb, before it enters the upper strait; and in other cases, when very
small, or long dead, it will pass folded double. This self-turning
however, cannot take place after the escape of the waters, so that it
seldom occurs when the membranes are broken.</p>


<h5>MECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE TRUNK BY SPONTANEOUS
EVOLUTION.</h5>

<p>This is the most usual mode for the fœtus to escape,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in each presentation, and in every position. By referring to the
following Plates, and the accompanying descriptions, it will be readily
understood.</p>

<p>Previous to the rupture of the membranes the child's body lies
<em>across</em>, as formerly explained; but immediately after the
rupture the shoulders descend into the Pelvis, as seen in the above
Plate, while the head remains above the pubes; the arm frequently, but
not always, protruding externally.</p>

<p>The shoulder then continues to descend, the body following, bent up

<p>The whole Trunk is now fully delivered, folded almost double, and
the legs and feet are turned up against the face. They speedily follow
however, and then nothing is left but the head, and perhaps one or both
arms, placed against the sides of it, as shown in Plate XXXVIII.</p>

<p>The arm is generally very easily brought down, or it may remain
and come with the head. The delivery of the head is effected the same
as in presentations of the pelvis, and is seldom attended with much
difficulty, the parts having been so much distended. The body always
rotates so that the back comes in front, and the chin passes into the
curve of the Sacrum.</p>

<p>This is the way in which the delivery is effected<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> by
nature in such cases, and it will readily be conceived how dangerous
it is to both mother and child, and how seldom it can be accomplished.
If the Fœtus be of a full size, and the mother's pelvis no larger than
ordinary, it is almost impossible for this spontaneous evolution to
take place; and even when it does, it is with the greatest difficulty,
the mother suffering in an extreme degree, and running great risk, not
only of the most serious after results, but even of death. To the child
the danger is equally great, owing to the severe and long-continued
compression it receives, and the unnatural position it assumes. M.
Velpeau tells us that in <em>one hundred and thirty-seven</em> such
cases, <em>one hundred and twenty-five</em> of the children died. The
number of the mothers also, who either died or were made sufferers all
their future lives, was undoubtedly great, though unknown.</p>

<p>It is evident therefore, that presentations of the Trunk are the
most unfavorable known, and labor in them is but rarely spontaneous.
Nature can but very seldom effect the delivery of the Fœtus herself,
and even when she does it is with the greatest risk, both to it and
the mother. The accoucheur should <em>always</em> assist therefore, if
he can, because even if nature can complete the delivery it is with
such danger. The means of assisting, by turning, will be described in
another Chapter.</p>

<p>If the fœtus is not at full term, and of course is under the
full size, its expulsion may be left to nature safely, but not
otherwise.</p>

the <em>Mechanism of Delivery</em>, in all the various presentations
and positions, it is necessary to explain the physiological phenomena
attending a natural labor, and the duties of the accoucheur when

<h4>CHAPTER XV.</h4>

<h5>OF DELIVERY IN GENERAL.</h5>


<h5>DIFFERENT KINDS OF DELIVERY.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the child is brought into the world
by the unaided efforts of nature, and without any accident to itself or
the mother, it is called a <em>Natural Delivery</em>. When it occurs
by the efforts of nature alone, but not advantageously for both, it
is not called natural, but simply <em>Spontaneous Delivery</em>. And
when assistance is required it is called an <em>Artificial</em>, or
<em>difficult Delivery</em>. It is also called <em>precocious</em>, or
<em>tardy</em>, according as it comes before or after the full term.</p>


<h5>CAUSES OF LABOR.</h5>

<p>What it is that causes labor to commence, and proceed, is not
fully known. At the proper time the Uterus prepares to cast out the
fœtus it has so long retained, in the same manner that the tree casts
off its fruit, and from some efficient cause which we have not yet
discovered.</p>

<p>It is probable that, when the fœtus attains a certain size, it
presses upon the nerves of the neck of the Uterus and irritates them,
and they react again upon the muscular fibres of the Womb and cause
them to contract, and so expel its contents. This is much the same
action, in fact, as vomiting. When any body very repugnant to the
stomach is swallowed, it irritates the nerves of that organ, and then
they excite its muscular fibres, which, by forcible contractions, expel
the offender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>It is possible, also, that the fœtus itself may instinctively
assist in bringing about its own delivery, as was supposed of old by
Hippocrates, and more lately by Harvey and others. It is certain that
labor is both more difficult, and more dangerous, when the child is
dead; though it may take place as usual after the death of the mother,
providing the child be still alive. Several instances of this kind have
been known, when the living child was expelled from the Womb, by the
natural process, sometime after the mother had ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>The contraction of the muscular fibres of the Womb however, must be
regarded as the immediate or efficient cause of fœtal expulsion, let
them be brought on how they may. The muscles of the Abdomen, and the
diaphragm, also assist, in the last stage, but are not essential.</p>

<p>The young of some of the lower animals are observed to perform
certain peculiar motions, during delivery, by which it is much
facilitated; and this is considered a proof, by some, that voluntary
movements of the fœtus assist in the process. Certainly if it be
supposed, as we have shown there is good grounds for doing, that the
child assists in placing itself in the best <em>position</em>, it is
equally probable that it also assists in its own expulsion, in other
ways.</p>


<h5>SIGNS OF DELIVERY.</h5>

<p><i>Premonitory Signs.</i>&mdash;A few days before delivery the Uterus
descends much lower, so that the diaphragm and stomach are less pressed
upon, and the breathing and digestion becomes easier in consequence.
The ease which is thus experienced is sometimes so great that the
female becomes unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213"
id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> animated and cheerful, and cannot think
she is so near her travail. This is not always the case however, for
some on the contrary feel very uncomfortable and melancholy. The
lips of the Vulva are also apt to swell and become painful, and the
lower limbs numbed and cramped, owing to the child's head pressing
on the large nerves. The neck of the bladder is also very liable to
be compressed, so that a constant desire is felt to urinate, and a
similar trouble may also be experienced in the Rectum. Most of these
inconveniences, but particularly the numbness and cramps in the limbs,
are not likely to be experienced except when the head presents, because
no other part is so formed as to be able to descend sufficiently low;
when they are felt therefore, the female may console herself by the
reflection that they indicate, with tolerable certainty, that the
child is presenting in the best position it can for a safe and speedy
delivery.</p>

<p>Standing, or walking, usually become more difficult, and swelling of
the external parts, or piles, are apt to occur. With some females also,
a sudden diarrhœa, or vomiting, takes place, and troubles them up to
the period when labor commences.</p>

<p>Finally the Uterus begins to contract, though insensibly at first;
the Abdomen becomes unusually hard, and flying pains are experienced,
particularly with first children. This continues with more or less
of intermission, up to the actual period of labor, which is usually
divided into <em>three</em> periods, each of which must be considered
separately.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XVI.</h4>

<h5>THE PROGRESS, PHENOMENA, AND DURATION OF NATURAL LABOR.</h5>


<h5>FIRST PERIOD.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> making an examination the mouth of the
Womb will be found to be dilating, and a discharge of mucus, tinged
with blood, issuing from it. The membranes may also be felt protruding
into the Vagina, and distended, like a bladder. The female complains of
being drawn powerfully together in the inside; she trembles, and gasps
for breath; her pulse sinks, and she often becomes sick and deadly
faint; she complains of great thirst, and breaks out into profuse
perspiration; frequently she will weep, and apparently suffer from some
terrible apprehension, while her strength will be completely exhausted.
Occasionally however, she will be perfectly passive, and almost
immoveable, appearing as if in a dream.</p>

<p>The pains however, gradually become more and more acute, and
closer together; the patient is excited and irritable; her pulse
becomes quicker again, the thirst increases, and vomiting frequently
ensues. Before each pain she frequently experiences a severe chill,
with chattering of the teeth, and not unfrequently becomes perfectly
delirious.</p>

<p>With each pain the mouth of the Womb expands more and more, till
at last it totally disappears, and the cavity of the Uterus and the
Vagina form but one uniform passage, which is completely occupied
with the distended membranes, or bag of waters, which may be felt
like a soft round tumor. This is well represented in the following
Plate:&mdash;</p>

   </div>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>Fig. 1 shows the state of the parts at the beginning
of labor. The mouth of the Womb is considerably dilated, and the
Membranes, A, are protruding slightly.</p>

    <p>Fig. 2 shows the state of the parts at the end of
the first period. The neck of the Womb is now so fully dilated that it
forms a continuous passage with the Vagina, while the bag of waters, A,
projects far down and occupies the whole width of the canal.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The first period may be much protracted, and is generally
very exhausting, though not attended with any danger or special
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216"
id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h5>SECOND PERIOD.</h5>

<p>At this stage all the previous symptoms become much exaggerated.
The contractions are more powerful, and the pains more acute, but
with a perfect period of repose between them, during which the female
will feel quite easy, and even sometimes fall asleep, but only to be
aroused by the pains coming on again. The muscles of the Abdomen,
and the diaphragm, are now called into play; the patient strains, or
violently bears down, and pants with exertion, while the perspiration
streams from every pore, the pulse quickens, and the expression of the
countenance betrays the wildest anxiety and excitement.</p>

<p>The bag of waters now descends, and enlarges more and more, until
at last, being unable any longer to bear the strain to which it is
subject, it bursts, and the waters flow away in a profuse gush.
Immediately this takes place the head descends, and closes up the
passage; the pains cease for a time, and the patient again has a
respite, while the uterus apparently gains fresh power. Very soon the
contractions recommence, more energetically even than before, the
head passes the mouth of the Womb and enters the Vagina, which keeps
enlarging as it descends, till it reaches the lower part, or floor of
the pelvis. The pains now become more violent than ever, the patient
screams with agony, clutches hold of any object near her, throws
herself back, draws in her breath, and bears down with all the force
she can command.</p>

<p>The fearful cries which most females emit at this time appear
to assist the delivery, by the convulsive efforts at breathing
which they necessitate, and the expulsive straining also does
the same. These natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"
id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> efforts are much assisted by providing a
firm support for the patient's feet, against which she can push, which
she will do with tremendous force.</p>

<p>The head now presses, at each pain, against the perineum, which
begins to project outwards, as also does the Rectum. The Vulva begins
to dilate, the lips separate wider and wider, and part of the child's
head becomes visible. Gradually the lips become thinner and thinner,
and at last disappear nearly altogether, so that the mouth of the Vulva
is only composed of thin ring, which seems ready to give way every
moment. The head however recedes, and the parts again assume something
like their natural condition for a short time, when the same process
again takes place, and the distension proceeds still further, while the
head does not retire so far. This alternate action is repeated perhaps
many times, so that the external mouth is opened gradually, and without
the lips or perineum being torn, which they would be if the head were
to pass suddenly, before they were softened and dilated.</p>

<p>After this has been continued for a sufficient period a strong
expulsive pain is felt, the female screams, the head passes clean
through the external opening, and the lips close round the neck.
This however, is only for an instant, the rest of the body speedily
following the head, in the manner hereafter to be explained. Most
usually, in fact, the whole body follows the head without any stoppage
at all, but sometimes there is a delay of a few seconds.</p>

<p><i>The Third period of delivery</i> comprises the delivery of the
Placenta, which will occupy our attention in another place.</p>

<p><i>Differences in the process of Labor.</i>&mdash;Although, in most
cases, labor proceeds much in the way I have<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> just explained, and is
attended with similar phenomena, yet still we occasionally see marked
exceptions. This is particularly the case with regard to <em>pain</em>.
Most females suffer severely at this time, and some even the most
torturing agony, while others again experience scarcely anything
to complain of, and some even feel nothing at all. I am acquainted
with a lady at the present time, the mother of several children, who
assures me she never felt any pain at all in her labors, nor was she
in any ways exhausted by them. I have known her rise from her bed in
the night, from feeling indications of the approaching event, make
all her arrangements, and send for the nurse, as if it was the most
ordinary affair imaginable. On one of these occasions, before her
husband returned with the assistants, she was delivered while alone,
without any difficulty, and they found her sitting up in bed nursing
the child. She had cut it loose, and tied up the cord herself, having
heard how to do so at one of my Lectures, and actually brought away
the Placenta with her own hand. In two days after she was about as
usual. And yet this lady was by no means strong, nor remarkably
healthy; and what is very singular, she suffered severe pains at most
of her monthly periods; much more, as she assured me, than from all
her labors put together. M. Chailly also mentions an instance of a
young girl of sixteen, with her first pregnancy, whose Vagina was also
partly closed by an internal membrane, whose delivery nevertheless was
almost painless. She woke up, he tells us, about four o'clock in the
morning, with some very slight pains, which scarcely disturbed her, but
which continued till about six, when the child was born suddenly and
safely, without any assistance, and with scarcely any increase<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> of
pain to the mother. I have known many other such cases as these, and
plenty of them can be found recorded; but what this fortunate exemption
from suffering, in such cases, depends upon, is not known.</p>

<p>The nature, and the seat of the pains, is also very variable. Some
only feel a dull sort of aching, with powerful contraction, or drawing
together, while others call it <em>grinding</em>, <em>cutting</em>, and
<em>burning</em> pain. Some feel it in the back, and some at front,
while others feel it most in the groins, and others again experience it
in all these parts at once. The peculiar sharp pain which results from
the extreme dilatation of the external mouth, when the head passes, is
perhaps the most constantly felt, and the most alike in all.</p>

<p>The manner in which the mouth of the Womb opens, and the time
required for its dilatation, differ much in different cases. In females
who have previously borne children, as before explained, the mouth is
always considerably opened at the full term, while in a first pregnancy
it is nearly closed, even till some time after the labor actually
commences. Sometimes the dilatation takes place rapidly, and at others
very slowly; it is especially liable to be delayed if the Membranes
break too soon, because then the pressure of the bag of waters is lost,
and that is an important agent in expanding the Os Uteri. In some
cases the neck of the Womb is very hard and rigid, so that a long time
is required to make it give way. When any other part than the head
presents also, the opening of the mouth will not take place so soon,
because no other part so completely fills up the passage.</p>

<p>The breaking of the bag of waters will sometimes occur very
early, almost as soon as it protrudes;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> while at other times
it will be delayed till the whole Vagina is filled up by it, or even
till it appears externally. The quantity of the water discharged at
the time of the rupture is also variable; if the presenting part of
the fœtus does not completely block up the passage, the whole may
pass away when the rupture takes place; but if it does, as is usually
the case when the head presents, only a part flows then, and the rest
comes in gushes, as the head is raised, and when the child is born.
The too early escape of the waters, as already explained, may retard
the delivery, by delaying the expansion of the mouth of the Womb; and
in this way unskilful accoucheurs have caused lingering labors, by
breaking the membranes too soon.</p>

<p>It is important to recollect also, as I explained before, that a
portion of fluid sometimes exists between the amnion and chorion,
which may pass first, and induce the belief that the true waters have
escaped, when they have not. This is called the <em>false waters</em>,
or <em>shows</em>, and is not connected with the true waters at all.</p>

<p>The <em>general</em> physiological phenomena of a natural delivery
having thus been explained, we have now to state its duration, and then
proceed to its conduct or management.</p>


<h5>DURATION OF NATURAL LABOR.</h5>

<p>The duration of natural labor is not by any means constantly the
same, nor can it be predicted with anything like certainty in any
case; but still by keeping careful records, and by duly observing
a vast number of cases, a tolerable approximation can <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>be
made. There are various circumstances that tend to lengthen the
duration of labor, some general, and others belonging to the
individual. The mode of life and early habits of the female, the
climate in which she lives, and the manner in which she has conducted
herself during gestation, all have an important influence. As a general
rule, the period becomes longer in proportion to the civilization of
the community in which she lives. The first labor is generally more
tedious than the succeeding ones, owing to the slower dilatation of
the parts. It is also thought by some, that the labor is longer in
proportion to the age of the female, particularly with the first child;
but this opinion is not well founded.</p>

<p>The average duration of labor in our country, is <em>from eight to
twelve hours</em>. In some parts it is longer than this, and in others
again it is much shorter. I have good reason also to think, that it is
longer in cities than in the country.</p>

<p>An experienced practitioner can sometimes predict with tolerable
certainty, when called to a labor, how long it will be before it is
over; but this is seldom the case, and most frequently his success is
owing more to chance than to judgment. If the mouth of the womb be
well dilated, the contractions powerful, and the patient vigorous,
with the presentation natural, he is of course justified in predicting
a speedy delivery; or the reverse, if these favorable conditions do
not exist. Many unforeseen conditions may exist, however, and many
accidents arise, that may falsify an apparently safe conclusion. No
judicious practitioner, except in a few rare cases, will hazard his
reputation by fixing any <em>time</em>, and no well informed patient
would <em>ask</em> him to do so, because she would know that it was out
of his power.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h4>CHAPTER XVII.</h4>

<h5>THE CONDUCT OR MANAGEMENT OF A NATURAL LABOR.</h5>


<h5>PRELIMINARY REQUISITES.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> most cases of natural labor there is
not much assistance needed. The assistant should, however, possess
a certain <em>tact</em>, or <em>manner</em>, calculated to make a
favorable impression on the patient. This is especially needed <em>when
a man officiates</em>. It must be recollected, that the situation
of the female at such times is a very peculiar one, and that the
presence of one of the other sex, however necessary, must be more or
less objectionable to her. He should, therefore, carefully exhibit in
his behavior the most refined delicacy, combined with a warm sympathy
and kind consideration; thus soothing her scruples and enlisting her
gratitude. He must also appear perfectly self-possessed under all
circumstances, and then she will have full confidence in his skill
and judgment. It may seem scarcely necessary to state these things,
but I have often known men officiate without such qualifications, and
also be perfectly unaware of their deficiencies. Such accoucheurs
never officiate well; they may be skillful and attentive, but yet
unsuccessful, and unappreciated. They are only <em>tolerated</em>, but
not respected, and are never fully confided in.</p>

<p>When requested to see a woman supposed to be in labor, it is
always advisable to be prompt in paying the visit, because delivery
sometimes comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, and both mother and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> child
may be in great danger if no one is near to assist.</p>

<p>Some time before the event is expected, it is advisable to provide
certain articles, which will or may be needed at the time, and which
should not have to be looked for at the last moment. A pair of sharp
scissors, with a piece of strong thread or cord, are indispensable, and
a female catheter may be needed. A quill with the feather part on, may
also be useful; and some pure lard or sweet oil is frequently called
for. The professional accoucheur will also find it a good precaution
to have his stethoscope in his pocket, and a lancet, if he ever relies
upon bleeding in any contingency. A small box of extract of Belladonna
also, may often be of great and immediate service.</p>


<h5>PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS.</h5>

<p>The first thing required when visiting the patient, is of course
to ascertain positively whether she be pregnant, and whether labor
is really commenced, and if so how far it has progressed. This
necessitates an examination, the proposal and making of which require
the most delicate tact, particularly if it be with a comparative
stranger, or in a first labor. No allusion to it should be made
to the patient herself by the assistant; he should converse with
<em>her</em> about indifferent matters, or merely upon her health,
and state his wishes to the <em>nurse</em> or female friend, and then
retire. This gives them time to inform her of what is required, and
to make the necessary preparation. On entering the room again, he
should not proceed abruptly, but resume the conversation, and make
some of the necessary arrangements while carrying it on. He should
seat himself by the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224"
id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> of the bed, with his right hand next
her, and his face opposite hers. Then passing his hand under the bed
clothes, after having lubricated it with lard or oil, he can proceed
with the examination as if it were a simple ordinary proceeding. By
exhibiting no hurry, and appearing to think it nothing unusual or in
any way strange, the female herself will cease to think it so, and will
not be flurried or shocked.</p>

<p>The hand must be passed under the female's right thigh, her knees
being elevated. She should, of course, lie on her back, and as near
to the edge of the bed as convenient. Not the slightest exposure is
necessary, nor allowable under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>The fore-finger being introduced, <i lang="fr"
xml:lang="fr">ballotment</i> may be practised, to ascertain if pregnancy
really exists; and if the evidence from this source is not sufficient,
auscultation must be resorted to. After being satisfied on this point,
the mouth of the womb must be carefully examined, and its degree of
dilatation noticed. If the female has pains, their character and
frequency must also be noticed, and the effects they produce on the
parts. It will generally be possible by these means, to discover how
far the labor has progressed, and even to form an opinion how long it
is likely to last. The general form of the parts and their size, should
also be noticed; particularly of the pelvis, so that any deformity or
deficiency may be discovered. And lastly, the <em>presentation</em>
should be ascertained, if possible, so that it may be known in time
whether nature will be sufficient herself or will require helping. The
<em>position</em> need not be cared for at present, because it is of
little consequence when the presentation is favorable.</p>

<p>The time required to make the examination need<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> not
be long, and should always be as short as possible.</p>

<p>While conversing with the patient, much useful information may be
gained. The general state of her health, the nature of her pains, and
the time they first commenced, should all be known; and if she has
had children before, it will be highly useful to know what kind of a
labor she had; whether it was long or short, easy or difficult, and
particularly if attended with any accident likely to occur again.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be remarked that great caution is needed in these
cases, many eminent men having been deceived as to the patient's
condition, as already stated in our chapter on the signs of pregnancy.
And many times the doctor has been summoned under the supposition
that labor had begun, while it was yet far off. The pains may be
false ones, such as frequently occur towards the end of pregnancy,
and may all pass away. These false pains, however, can usually be
distinguished, being continuous and irregular, while the true ones
intermit with periods of almost perfect ease, and are tolerably
regular. The false pains are also felt in various parts, while the
true ones are chiefly fixed in the uterus and vagina. Sometimes,
however, the difficulty in distinguishing them is very great, and the
accoucheur has often waited for several hours and even days; the labor
meanwhile making no progress; and eventually all has passed off, and
the patient has risen again from her bed. I know one case, where a
gentleman attended nearly <em>three days</em>, at the end of which
time the patient <em>rose and walked down stairs</em>. She was not put
to bed till <em>six weeks after</em>. I can scarcely think, however,
that these mistakes can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> happen very frequently, if the
examination be properly conducted.</p>


<h5>PREPARATIONS FOR THE DELIVERY.</h5>

<p>If it appears from the examination that labor has really commenced,
or is about to do so, everything should be at once prepared. All
useless persons should leave the room, and also those who would be
likely to alarm or grieve the patient by uttering cries, or exhibiting
fear; but no objection should be made to any one being present whom she
wishes to see, unless they cannot be depended upon. Thus some females
always wish to have their husbands with them, but others do not, though
they are averse to saying so. In these cases the accoucheur, if he be
an attentive observer, will soon see what is really desired by his
patient, and will manage matters accordingly.</p>

<p>The dress of the female should be perfectly loose, consisting of
a wrapper or night-gown, but sufficiently complete and warm to allow
of her getting up to walk in the chamber, if she desires it, as some
do. No corsets, garters, or other tight bandages, however, should be
allowed.</p>

<p>The bed should be prepared by placing the mattress on the top, or
by removing all from it; and then placing a thick layer of blankets
or quilts, with a folded sheet over them. This is to provide a firm
level surface, in which the body will not sink, and also to prevent
the fluids soaking through. It is an excellent plan, if the material
can be obtained, to place a thin oil-skin or India-rubber cloth under
the folded sheets, as this keeps all perfectly dry underneath. Some
persons also place another folded sheet,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> or a cushion, under the
pelvis, to keep it elevated; but this is not necessary, unless the bed
sinks in very much. It is also advisable to leave a foot-board or other
firm body, against which the female can press her feet when bearing
down; and a long towel folded lengthways should be passed under the
back, so that it can be raised up by a person lifting at each end. This
will often be found a better mode of <em>pressing the back</em>, which
nearly all patients call for, than by merely forcing the hand against
it, which is both tiresome and insufficient. Another towel may also be
firmly fixed to the bottom of the bed, so that she can <em>pull</em> by
it, at the same time that she pushes with her feet.</p>

<p>Some persons are confined on a cot, but this is not a very good
arrangement, because it sinks in too much in the middle, and is not
sufficiently large and firm. It is advantageous in one respect,
however, as it can be placed by the side of the bed, into which the
patient can be lifted when all is over, and be comparatively dry and
comfortable. This is the most frequent plan in France. If the bed be
properly arranged however, the under sheet can be withdrawn, and clean
warm napkins then passed under the body, which will be equally as good.
The covering should consist of a sheet, with blanket or coverlid,
according to temperature, and should, of course, never be removed,
except under peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>The chamber itself should be as quiet as possible, <em>well
ventilated</em>, and not too warm. Nothing distresses the patient more
than a close, hot atmosphere.</p>

<p>The accoucheur need not, of course, be present while these
arrangements are being made; and when he retires he should suggest
to the nurse that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228"
id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> female may attend to the bowels and
bladder during his absence. This precaution may both facilitate the
labor, and prevent much future annoyance. It would even be advisable
to administer an injection if necessary, of thin starch and a little
castor oil, rather than leave the bowels unmoved.</p>

<p>In regard to nourishment, nothing is needed or proper in the shape
of solid food; because all the energies of the system are concentrated
in the uterus, and as digestion cannot therefore go on, it would only
be an evil. If the labor is much protracted however, some broth or
soup may be taken, or a little milk. As a general rule, no spirituous
liquors or stimulating drinks of any kind should be taken; because
they impart no real strength, and may produce inflammation, or
congestion on the brain. Some females always prefer tea to drink,
others lemonade, toast water, gruel, or barley water, and others again
simple cold water, which is perhaps the best of all. In cases of great
exhaustion it is sometimes advisable, and even necessary, to give a
little wine, or brandy and water, but it should always be cautiously
administered.</p>

<p>In some parts it is customary for the female to lie on her side
during delivery, with a pillow between the knees; some even choose
this mode, and others will desire to stand, or place themselves on
their knees. The most frequent position however, and certainly the
most convenient, is on the back, though it may often be changed with
advantage under peculiar circumstances. In the early stages of labor
she can lie, or move about, as she chooses, or even rise if more
agreeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229"

<h5>ATTENDANCE AFTER THE PREPARATIONS ARE MADE, AND DURING THE
DELIVERY.</h5>

<p>When everything is arranged the assistant should take his seat on
the right hand of his patient and repeat the examination. If the head
presents, he need not concern himself much further at present, but
if it be any other part, he should prepare at once to change it, or
assist, as the case may be. At this second examination the parties
present, and the female herself are usually anxious to know if the
child is <em>coming right</em>, and how long the labor is likely to
last. The answer to these inquiries should be guarded and circumspect
in regard to the duration, because of its uncertainty, but if the
presentation is right, it is well to say so at once, because this gives
great comfort and encouragement. If it be unfortunately wrong, it is
best not to say so abruptly, but remark that it is rather obscure,
or cannot yet be fully distinguished, and so keep up the spirits of
the female while you await the proper time, or make the necessary
arrangements, to interfere; and then tell her there is a little
difficulty which requires to be righted, but which will not be serious,
nor cause much delay.</p>

<p>If the labor steadily progresses it is necessary to remain with the
female and attend to it; but if it be delayed, and everything remains
natural, she may be left for a time with advantage. When the second
stage is fairly commenced however, and especially after the membranes
are broken, the attention should be unremitting. The state of the
parts should be ascertained frequently, so that the actual progress
may be known, and any necessary assistance rendered. The state of the
bladder especially should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230"
id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> be observed, and if it be full and
the female unable to urinate, the catheter should be passed. Neglect
of this precaution may lead to serious accidents. While making the
examinations, the hand should be introduced with great care, so as not
to bruise or lacerate the parts, and it should not remain longer than
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Many females exhaust themselves unnecessarily by bearing down, and
straining, with great force, from the very commencement of labor,
under the mistaken idea that it is necessary to do so, or will assist.
They should be told not to do so however, till after the membranes are
broken, and not even then unless the neck of the womb begins to dilate.
They should also be told not to make any effort except <em>during a
pain</em>, as it will not assist at any other time.</p>

<p>No attempt should be made, under ordinary circumstances, to rupture
the membranes, or dilate the mouth of the womb, even though nature may
be slow in doing so. Patience must be practised, both by the female and
by her assistant, and sometimes it is severely tried.</p>

<p>When the waters have escaped, and the orifice is opened, an
examination must be made, to discover whether the cord has descended,
or either of the arms, as is sometimes the case, and if so, they must
be returned if possible.</p>

<p>As the head descends to the bottom of the pelvis it compresses
the rectum, and produces a feeling as if the bowels must be moved,
or even causes them to be so. This is apt to distress the female,
and make her wish to rise, which cannot be permitted. If anything of
the kind occurs no notice should be taken of it, or she may even be
assured she is mistaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231"
id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> while a clean napkin may be interposed.
This, as Dr. Chailly observes, will soothe her delicacy. Such an
accident is very apt to occur towards the end of the labor.</p>

<p>When the head has rotated, and presents at the external opening, or
vulva, and begins to distend it, the greatest care is required. This
is a critical period, during which the accoucheur can render more real
assistance than at almost any other. There is danger at this time, as
formerly explained, of the head passing through too quickly, before
the parts are sufficiently relaxed, and so causing them to rupture.
This is particularly the case with the perineum, against which the head
presses with great force. It is necessary therefore to <em>support
the perineum</em>, as it is termed, to prevent this accident. This
is done by passing the right arm under the patient's right thigh,
and placing the palm of the hand flat against the perineum, with the
thumb encircling one side of the vulva, and the forefinger the other.
The hand is then gently, but firmly, pressed against the part during
every pain, so as to prevent the head passing too quickly, and also
to <em>elevate it</em>, and thus relieve the perineum of part of the
strain, and throw the occiput under the pubes.</p>

<p>Some practitioners also pass the left hand over the thigh, at
the same time, and grasp the back of the head with it, thus holding
the head as it were between the two hands, so as to direct it at
pleasure.</p>

<p>The manner of doing this is represented in plate XXXIX.</p>

</p>

<p>It is also necessary to request the female at this time to moderate
her efforts, and not bear down too strongly. If however she be too
excited, and eager to do so, more care must be used, and the head
pressed back still more forcibly, till the parts are fully relaxed.
For want of these precautions there is often serious lacerations of
the perineum and vulva, particularly in first labors, and when the
parts are unusually rigid. If proper care be bestowed however, these
accidents ought to occur but seldom, even in the worst cases, and
nothing can be more hurtful to the reputation of an accoucheur than for
them to happen. Sometimes it is necessary to support the perineum for
hours, and to bestow constant attention the whole time. It is often
useful to keep applying a little simple ointment, or lard, in the
intervals of the pains, mixed with the extract of Belladonna, which
will soften and relax the parts. Dr. Lee also advises the application
of a sponge, dipped in warm water, and which would probably do much
good in many cases.</p>

<p>It will of course be understood that the pressure only needs to be
made <em>during the pains</em>; when the head draws back the ointment
or warm sponge may be applied. The knees of the female should be held
up by some one, if she bears down too much, so as to prevent her from
doing so too powerfully.</p>

<p>When it is felt that the parts are fully relaxed, and sufficiently
distended, the head is left at liberty, during a strong pain, and it
immediately passes the outer ring, or is born.</p>

<p>It should then be held up, towards the pubes, and the mucus should
be cleaned from the mouth with one of the fingers, so that the child
may breathe. A careful examination should also be made round<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> the
neck, to see if the umbilical cord is around it. If it be so, but is
not tight, it may be left alone, or pulled a little over one shoulder,
or even passed clean over the head, if it can be <em>easily</em> drawn
out long enough. When it is very tight, and cannot be eased, it must be
cut through, or it will strangle the child.</p>

<p>In most cases the shoulders follow immediately after the head, the
uterus resting only a few moments; but if they do not the head may be
<em>slightly</em> drawn upon, or the fore-finger of the right hand may
be linked under the arm, and a <em>little</em> force employed, though
very carefully. It is better however to wait even two or three minutes,
and only resort to these means when there is evidently a partial
suspension of the natural efforts. Sometimes also the contractions may
be brought on again by merely pressing the hand over the fundus of
the uterus, and this should therefore be tried first. In all cases it
being better to let the uterus expel the child than to bring it away by
manual force.</p>

<p>During the passage of the shoulders the perineum needs as much care
as during the passage of the head, and must be supported in the same
way. Indeed some authors are of opinion that most cases of laceration
are caused by the shoulders.</p>

<p>After the shoulders are expelled the limbs and body speedily follow.
The child should be received in the hands of the accoucheur, and laid
on its side, at a little distance from the vulva, so that it may not
be suffocated by the discharged fluids. He should then take a strong
ligature and pass it <em>twice</em> round the umbilical cord, about two
inches from the navel, and also at about four inches, and then cut the
cord through, between the two bands, with a pair of sharp scissors. The
child may then be handed to the nurse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The tying of the cord is by some deemed unnecessary, and in most
cases probably is so, but as children have been known to bleed to
death, when it was not done, it should never be neglected. Some
practitioners only tie it once, leaving that part open which is still
attached to the placenta, and they suppose this is advantageous,
inasmuch as it partly empties the placenta of its blood, and so helps
to detach it. There is little or no fear, as some suppose, that this
bleeding can be extensive enough to hurt the female, or second child
if there be one, and even if it were likely to be so it could soon be
stopped; it has the inconvenience however of soiling the bed more, and
this is probably one great reason why the second ligature is applied,
which certainly is not <em>necessary</em>.</p>

<p>In my directions I have said that the cord may be tied about two
inches from the abdomen, and this will be sufficient if the child
breathes; but if not it should be left about four inches long, so as
to give room to cut it again, which is occasionally needed, as will
be seen further on. The knot should be drawn very tight, and great
care must be taken never to tie it so near as to pinch the skin of
the abdomen, which passes a little distance up it. A small portion of
the intestine will enter the cord sometimes, and swell it out for an
inch or more; this must be pressed back with the thumb and finger, and
carefully avoided by the ligature. Some practitioners cut the cord
first and tie it after, but I think the other plan is decidedly the
safest and the best.</p>

<p>After this is accomplished the accoucheur should place his
hand again over the fundus of the uterus, to discover whether
it contracts, and also to judge whether there be another fœtus.
If the womb is felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238"
id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> drawn up into <em>a hard round
ball</em>, in the middle of the abdomen, all is right, and no
apprehension need be felt; but if it remains unaltered in size, and is
soft, <em>flooding</em> is to be feared, and the hand should be firmly
pressed, or kneaded, over the fundus, to bring on contraction.</p>

<p>If there be another fœtus, the womb will remain much the same as
before labor, and the child may also be felt. It is better however to
make an examination internally, and then, in most cases, the membranes
and presenting part of the second fœtus will be found at the upper
strait. If there be any doubt after this it is even better to carry the
hand a little way into the womb, than to remain in ignorance on such an
important point. The delivery of the second fœtus usually follows close
upon the first, though sometimes there will be a delay of some hours,
or even days. And in general there is little or no difficulty with the
second, owing to the parts having been already prepared; but the longer
it is delayed the less easy it becomes.</p>

<p>Immediately the birth is fully effected the female feels, as most of
them express it, <em>in heaven</em>; there is an almost instantaneous
change, from the most agonizing pain to a state of perfect ease.
She ceases her cries, and falls into a quiet and pleasing languor,
strikingly at variance with the state of intense excitement she was in
but a few moments before. This repose however, does not last long; the
Placenta yet remains, and a new effort is required to expel that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>


<h5>DELIVERY OF THE AFTER BIRTH, OR PLACENTA AND MEMBRANES.</h5>

<p>Unlike the Fœtus the Placenta is fast to the walls of the Womb,
and can only become separated from them by the contraction of their
substance, which usually commences soon after the birth of the child,
and is indicated by new pains, and a slight discharge of blood. In
about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, the accoucheur should
enquire of the patient whether she has felt any of these pains, and
he should also examine whether the Placenta has reached the mouth of
the Womb, or Vagina, so that he may remove it. If the pains have not
yet come on, and the Placenta is not in the passage, he should press
one hand on the fundus of the Womb, to promote its contraction still
further, and then gently draw upon the cord with the other, holding
it as high up as possible, either by a piece of linen around it, or
by looping it around the finger. It should be pulled very gently, but
steadily, downwards and backwards. If it be snatched, or drawn too
hard, it may break, and cause great trouble; or it may <em>pull down
the Womb</em>, and either invert it or bring on falling of the Womb
afterwards. The hand placed over the fundus can detect this accident,
and if the uterus be felt to <em>sink down</em> the cord must not be
drawn upon any longer. Pulling away the Placenta too soon, and with
rudeness, has often led to deplorable accidents. In nearly every case
it will gradually separate itself, and be delivered in about half an
hour, and should only be assisted by <em>slight</em> drawing on the
cord, and by pressing the fundus.</p>

<p>When the Placenta is completely detached there is seldom any
difficulty in its passing the neck of the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> Womb, and down the
Vagina, but it usually requires to be drawn through the external
opening by the hand. In doing this the membranes may be twisted round
the cord, so as to wind them altogether, and strengthen the cord.</p>

<p>In case the separation does not take place we must wait, and
continue the slight strain on the cord and the friction over the
fundus. It is not reckoned safe however, by most authors, to wait
more than an hour; and if there is no sign of its coming by that time
artificial delivery is resorted to. This is accomplished by carrying
the hand carefully up into the Womb, and separating the Placenta from
its walls with the fingers, and then bringing it down at once.</p>

<p>When the afterbirth has passed the Vulva, a careful examination
should be made of it, to see that no part is left behind; and for still
greater security it is advisable to explore the Vagina thoroughly, so
that any detached portion may be removed. The membranes are very apt to
become broken, and fragments of them left, which though ever so small
may cause trouble. The finger should also be passed into the mouth of
the Womb, so as to clear it; for sometimes a large clot of blood, or a
piece of the membranes, will remain and keep it open, and thus cause
severe flooding.</p>

<p>It is generally considered, by those who have bestowed attention
on the subject, that assistance should always be rendered, if the
afterbirth does not come very soon. There is danger, if it be
left too long, of the mouth of the Womb contracting and retaining
it; in which case it becomes absolutely necessary to abstract it,
but exceedingly difficult, and even dangerous, to do so. Dr. Lee
says it should never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241"
id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> left more than <em>an hour</em> at most,
and that it is best never to delay removing it even so long as that.</p>

<p>When left purposely, for observation, it is found to be expelled
spontaneously, and soon, only in a few cases; usually it remains
several hours, and most frequently it requires to be removed by hand.
No doubt it is <em>natural</em> for it to be expelled unaided, but
it must be borne in mind that our females are usually too weak, and
deficient in energy, to perform any unusual natural function without
assistance. The accoucheur must use great caution, so as neither to
intrude his help when not required, nor yet to refuse it when really
needed; and above all he must not substitute <em>violence</em> for
<em>skill</em>.</p>

<p>When the afterbirth is brought away, a bandage should be passed
round the body of the female, made of soft linen, twelve or fourteen
inches wide. It should be drawn moderately tight, and fastened
securely. If it pass round twice it will be all the better, and it
should be drawn down as near the pubes as possible. I know many ladies
who prefer the India Rubber bands, recently invented, as they press
more equally and firmly, and are put on with less trouble, being all in
one piece and drawn over the feet and limbs.</p>

<p>Some accoucheurs put on the wrapper immediately the child is born,
before the afterbirth passes away; but I think this is not the best
plan. When properly adjusted, the supporting band gives great comfort
to the female, and is very useful.</p>

<p>Some ladies provide a curious kind of <em>corset</em> to put
on, invented for the purpose, which however, as a celebrated
author recently remarked, "Are usually stiff and unyielding, like
the prejudices of their patrons, and often prove injurious."
None of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242"
id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> are equal to the simple contrivances
above-mentioned.</p>


<h5>ATTENTIONS TO THE FEMALE AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THE AFTERBIRTH.</h5>

<p>When the afterbirth is removed the patient should be left to repose
herself for about a quarter of an hour, during which time most of the
blood escapes, and then she must be made as comfortable as possible.
In France, and with many persons here, it is customary to cleanse the
patient with a sponge dipped in warm water, pass a clean warm sheet
under her, and then put on clean linen, after which she is lifted into
the clean bed, previously well warmed; the accoucheur himself carrying
her there. Most frequently however, the sponging is dispensed with till
some time after, and also the changing of beds&mdash;the under sheet
merely being withdrawn, and a warm dry one passed in its place, while
the female's limbs are gently wiped. In either case the female should
be disturbed as little as possible, particularly if there be danger
of flooding, and she should be carefully guarded from cold. When the
soiled and wet clothes are removed, as completely as possible, warm
napkins should be placed under the Pelvis and between the limbs, to
soak up the discharge, and they should be carefully changed as often
as needed, without uncovering the patient. If she be disposed to sleep
however, and is much exhausted, these attentions need not be pressed
too much till she is recovered a little.</p>

<p>Many persons here have a dread of using the sponge immediately,
and of being carried to another bed; but there is no danger from
either practice, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> ordinary cases, when carefully
performed; and it is so productive of <em>comfort</em>, that I never
knew one but what was pleased with and benefitted by it, and desirous
of its being done in their subsequent labors.</p>

<p>Some females will even rise and take a <em>cold bath</em>, or be
wrapped in a <em>wet sheet</em>, not only without evil effect but with
<em>positive advantage</em>. I would not advise any one to do this
however, <em>particularly if they are the least timid at it</em>,
<em>or doubtful of its propriety</em>. Without the mental stimulus
of <em>faith</em> and <em>hope</em> it may be hazardous. It shows
however, that many of the popular notions, as to the requirements and
susceptibilities of females, in this state, are entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>The patient may either experience great comfort after being thus
attended to, or she may complain very much. Some will even be attacked
with a kind of chill. Their teeth will chatter, and their hands and
feet grow quite cold. This however usually passes off, and she falls
asleep. The accoucheur ought to remain for an hour or two, even though
she sleeps soundly, and appears quite well, because she may become
suddenly worse, or flooding may set in with such violence as to
endanger life in a few minutes, when unchecked.</p>

<p>If the patient desires any nourishment she may take a little simple
soup, or gruel, but nothing stimulating, unless a little wine be needed
from extreme exhaustion.</p>


<h5>ATTENTIONS TO THE CHILD.</h5>

<p><i>Inspection when born</i>.&mdash;As soon as the child is born
its mouth and nose should be cleared from mucus, if that has not
been done already; and if it has not breathed, means should be
resorted to immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244"
id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> to make it do so. Sometimes the whole
head is covered with a thin membrane, called the <em>caul</em>, or
<em>veil</em>, which is most probably only a portion of the Amnion,
and which may cause suffocation. I remember a case of this kind in my
own practice, in which the caul was unnoticed at first, and the child
came near dying from it. Nothing could be seen, and as it bent before
the finger, when pressed into the mouth, it was totally unobserved. The
nurse however, called out that the child did not breathe, and a close
examination as to the cause soon revealed why. On passing the finger
under the edge of the membrane, which was round the neck, it came off
like a cap, and the child cried immediately.</p>

<p><i>Washing the child.</i>&mdash;The cleansing of the child may usually
be safely committed to the nurse, or other female attendants, though
some of them have very absurd and injurious practices in this respect.
Thus I have known them rub the whole body over with <em>whiskey</em>,
or <em>raw spirits</em>, before washing it, which must cause great
coldness from its evaporation, and also great irritation. The only
thing required is <em>perfect cleanliness</em>, and this should be
effected in the <em>quickest</em> and <em>simplest</em> manner. Some
very mild soap, and moderately warm water, is all that is really
needed, though a little sweet oil, or fresh lard, or butter, rubbed
on first, appears to facilitate the operation. The drying should be
done as quickly as possible, after all the mucus is washed off, and
with great care; the napkin being as soft as it can be, and never
<em>rubbed</em> hard, for it takes but little force to remove the
skin. Many persons take great trouble, and are a long time over this
infantile wash without succeeding well with it. They are deceived by
the tough mucus slipping under the hand, but still clinging<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> to
the body, where they leave it even after using the napkin; it then
dries on and forms a hard skin, very difficult to remove, and very
irritating. This can be avoided with care, and by using the oil first,
which appears to soften the mucus. Some persons use <em>flour</em>, or
<em>Indian meal</em>, and others <em>starch</em>, but none of these are
so good as the simple means we have described.</p>

<p><i>Dressing the child.</i>&mdash;After the washing and drying is
completed the child must be <em>dressed</em>, and this is a process in
which comfort and utility is frequently sacrificed to mere fashion and
prejudice, as it is in adults. The article next the skin should be of
soft line linen, which may be followed by others of warmer material,
according to the temperature. They should all be perfectly loose in
their make, and quite soft to the feel. As far as possible they should
all be fastened with <em>strings</em>, rather than <em>pins</em>. These
metallic points are troublesome to fix, and often injure the child, in
spite of every precaution. They are also apt to be referred to as the
cause of the child crying, and thus prevents other causes being sought
for, which frequently exist.</p>

<p>Some people put a thick flannel cap on the head, over a linen one,
but others leave this part altogether uncovered, which I think is the
best plan. At most there should only be the linen covering; the head
being better rather cool than otherwise.</p>

<p>The dressing of the cord is the next duty, and this is done by
taking several pieces of soft linen, oiled a little, and cutting a
small round hole in the middle of each, through which the cord is
passed. The linen then lies flat on the abdomen of the child, and
the cord on the top of that, the holes being just large enough for
it to pass easily through. Five or six<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> pieces are usually
put on, but very frequently only one is used, and is found quite
sufficient. It should be very fine, and soft. When this is done another
layer is laid over the cord, and then a bandage of soft linen, about
four or five inches wide, is passed two or three times over it, and
round the body. This completes the dressing, and the child may now be
wrapped up warmly and laid down to sleep&mdash;remembering, as Dr.
Chailly remarks, that if it be laid on a chair, or sofa, it may be
accidentally sat upon and killed, an accident which has happened.</p>


<h5>ACCIDENTS WHICH MAY HAPPEN.</h5>

<p>Before these dressings are needed however, there are frequently
other things of more importance to be attended to. If the labor has
been long, or the presentation unfavorable, the child may be born
<em>apoplectic</em>, from the pressure it has received. The face will
be puffed up, and of a blue color; the body will be swollen, and the
limbs without motion, while the pulsation will scarcely be felt, either
over the child's heart or in the cord. It will feel warm, and the limbs
will be quite flexible, but still there will be no signs of life. In
this case it should be exposed naked to the cool air, and even blown
upon; and if that does not resuscitate it the cord may be cut through
below the ligature, so as to let out two or three tea-spoonfuls of
blood. After this it generally revives, and begins to move, while its
face assumes a natural color, and the swelling goes down. The mouth and
throat should also be carefully cleaned with a quill feather, of all
mucus.</p>

<p>A more frequent accident is <em>Asphyxia</em>, or want of breathing,
in which case the surface of the body is<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> cold and pale, and no
breath whatever is drawn, though the heart beats quite naturally.
Very weak children, or those born before their time, are most likely
to become asphyxiated, or those delivered by instruments. The first
thing to be done is to carry the child to the open window, if it be
not exceedingly cold, and expose its head and chest to the air, while
the rest of the body is wrapped up warm. This will often make it gasp,
but if it does not a little cold water may be dashed on its face and
chest, and the throat may be tickled with a feather. The breech may
also be smartly slapped, and the chest well rubbed with the cold
hand. When it begins to breathe a little it may be put into a warm
bath up to the middle, and a warm injection may be given to it. In
most cases these means will speedily bring it round, but if they do
not the attendant should place his mouth close over that of the child
and breathe into it, so as to fill the lungs, and then press down
the chest to empty them again, repeating the process several times.
This may be called artificial breathing, and if it succeed once only
there is a probability of its effecting the desired object. The breath
however, must not be blown in too hard, or it may injure the child's
lungs, nor too rapidly. Sometimes a tube is used, which is passed
down into the throat; but it is troublesome, and not much better than
the mouth, if any at all. These efforts may be repeated twenty or
thirty times if necessary, or even more. In some cases it is requisite
to continue using some, or all of these means, for an hour or two
without intermission, before the child begins to breathe freely. I
knew an instance even, where the nurse continued to do so for <em>five
hours</em>, and at last fully recovered the child, though all present,
including the doctor, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248"
id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> given it up. She said she did not
despair while it continued <em>warm</em>, though it was doubtful
whether the heart beat or not. This may show that the attempt should
not be abandoned too soon.</p>

<p>In cases of asphyxia no blood should be lost at all, but on the
contrary the cord should be carefully examined to see if it is tied
fast; the bleeding from it frequently aggravating the evil.</p>

<p><i>Congenital weakness.</i>&mdash;Some children are born extremely weak,
and remain constantly debilitated and cold. This is very apt to be
the case when they are born before the full term, or when the mother
is diseased. They should be carefully wrapped in cotton, or very soft
flannel, and kept warm by bottles of warm water. Many instances are on
record of these weak children becoming afterwards extremely robust, so
that they need not be regarded with unmixed apprehension, nor neglected
from a supposition that they must die.</p>

<p><i>The child may be deformed.</i>&mdash;The accoucheur should also
carefully examine the child, to see if it be deformed in any way, or
has met with any accident, because in some of these cases assistance is
required immediately, and may be rendered at once.</p>

<p><i>The child's capability of endurance.</i>&mdash;The capability of
the new-born infant to endure extremes of cold is almost as great as
that of its mother, and sometimes even it is benefitted by them. With
many persons it is customary to plunge it in cold water, immediately
when born; and in Russia, we are told, it is even <em>rolled in the
snow</em>. In some cases these extremes may be beneficial, but in
others I have no doubt they prove fatal. A medium course is best, in
most instances, leaving the extreme to be resorted to when we wish a
sudden stimulus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249"
id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>When all these matters are carefully attended to, and both
mother and child have remained for an hour or two without any
unpleasant symptom, they may be left to the care of the ordinary
attendants, giving them strict orders to send for proper assistance
<em>immediately</em>, if anything unusual transpires.</p>


<h5>SUBSEQUENT ATTENTIONS TO MOTHER AND CHILD.</h5>

<p><i>The Bladder.</i>&mdash;One of the most important points to attend to
is the urine. A few hours after the delivery is fully effected, unless
the female is reposing, she should be asked whether she has any desire
to urinate; and, if she has, the convenience should be at once afforded
to do so. There is always more or less danger of retention of urine,
from the pressure that has been exerted on the bladder; and if it be
allowed to continue too long its removal becomes exceedingly difficult.
If on making the attempt the urine does not flow, the catheter must be
used, and the sooner the better. The pain arising from retention of
the urine has often been supposed to arise from inflammation of the
womb, or bowels&mdash;neither patient nor physician knowing its real
source, till the passage by the catheter gave relief. There have even
been instances of females dying, merely from an overcharged bladder,
while their attendants were industriously treating them for uterine
inflammation. This accident therefore, should always be suspected, and
a very little attention will prevent any mistake in regard to it. When
allowed to become too full the swollen bladder may be felt, just above
the pubes, hard and tender, so that the least pressure upon it causes
great pain. If not relieved it will at last burst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Bowels.</i>&mdash;If the bowels are not opened naturally, it will
be well, the following day, to administer an injection of thin starch
and water, or to prescribe a small dose of castor oil, or a seidlitz
powder. This should also be repeated for two or three days, till the
natural power is restored.</p>

<p><i>The Food.</i>&mdash;But little solid food should be taken, and nothing
stimulating. Gruel, milk, toast and water, Indian meal, light puddings,
or broth, should be the chief articles for some time. Roast apples are
also very good, being pleasant and relaxing. For refreshing drinks, if
there be any fever, lemonade or tamarind tea may be taken.</p>

<p><i>The After Pains.</i>&mdash;After the expulsion of the after-birth most
females experience, more or less, severe pains, almost like those of
labor, arising apparently from the further contraction of the uterine
walls to expel the coagulated blood. These pains are seldom or never
felt in first labors, but afterwards they are often most acute. I have
known many patients suffer <em>much more</em> from them than they
did during labor. They sometimes last only a few hours, or a day,
and sometimes even extend to six or eight days. Nothing that we know
of can prevent them, though many means are known of mitigating their
severity. If there be no tendency to flooding, a large poultice may be
placed over the abdomen, or it may be fomented, or covered with cloths
wrung out in hot water. An injection may also be used, either in the
Vagina or Rectum, consisting of warm thin starch, with about twenty
drops of laudanum; or either of the following recipes may be used
internally:&mdash;<em>Pills of Gum Camphor</em>, two, about the size
of ordinary pills, to be repeated, if necessary, in an hour.&mdash;Or,
<em>Syrup of Poppies</em>, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251"
id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> drachms; <em>Mucilage of Gum
Arabic</em>, two ounces; and <em>Solution of Sulphate of Morphia</em>,
ten drops; to be made into a mixture, <em>one-half</em> of which may
be taken at first, and the remainder in <em>two hours</em>, if the
patient is not relieved. This seldom fails.&mdash;It is necessary to
bear in mind that the pains arising from <em>inflammation</em> have
been mistaken for ordinary after-pains, and serious consequences have
resulted from the error. The after-pains however, are concentrated, and
<em>intermittent</em>, while the sensations from inflammation are more
diffused and constant, and are also usually attended by fever.</p>

<p><i>The Lochial Discharge.</i>&mdash;From the time of delivery until the
uterus has returned to its ordinary condition, there is poured from
it a discharge, at first like blood, and afterwards thin and light
colored, called the <em>Lochia</em>. The duration of this discharge
varies from one week to a month, and its quantity from one ounce to six
or eight ounces, daily. It gradually diminishes however, and frequently
stops for a few days altogether. In women who do not nurse it is both
more abundant, and lasts longer, than in those who do. The bloody color
usually disappears after the first or second day, though sometimes it
will show itself again, even when the discharge has nearly ceased,
particularly if the female exert herself too soon.</p>

<p>It appears that this discharge is essential to health, and great
attention should therefore be bestowed on the patient, if it be
too small, or cease too soon, or too suddenly. In most cases it
ceases naturally during the <em>milk fever</em>, and of course its
disappearance then need not excite alarm. Sometimes also, it does
not attain its full quantity till some days after its commencement.
If however, it remains small past the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> <em>third</em> day, or
does not appear when the milk fever is over, means should be taken
for increasing it. The best means for this purpose are <em>warm
poultices</em> and <em>fomentations</em> over the abdomen, and
injections in the rectum of simple warm water. Some practitioners
advise <em>two drachms of powdered Camphor</em> to be sprinkled on each
poultice, and probably it is an excellent addition. Occasionally the
lochia is very offensive, and in that case a simple cleansing injection
may be frequently used of thin starch, or Chammomile tea.</p>

<p>During the whole period of the Lochia in fact, even in ordinary
cases, the female will be all the more comfortable, and better, for
an occasional injection, and frequent washing. This is very much
neglected, though it never ought to be so. The only care required is
not to expose her to cold, which is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p><i>The Milk Fever.</i>&mdash;About the second or third day there usually
commences a peculiar temporary excitement in the system, called the
<em>milk fever</em>, which requires to be described because it may be
confounded with something more serious. It is generally ushered in by
headache, flushed face, and a hot dry skin; the pulse beats slowly, and
the breasts become hard, while the veins upon them appear very full. In
a short time however, the pulse becomes quicker, a perspiration breaks
out, and the breasts become still larger and fuller, so that the female
can scarcely bring her arms to her body. These symptoms last about a
day, or two days at most, and seldom become much aggravated.</p>

<p>Occasionally the milk fever is preceded by a slight chill, or by a
furred tongue, or sick stomach, but not very frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253"
id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The precise causes of this temporary fever are unknown, though
probably it is connected with the full establishment of the secretion
of milk, and hence its name. It is seldom very severe in those who
nurse, and frequently does not appear at all. During its continuance,
and for some time after, the female must carefully avoid exposure
to cold, and keep herself quiet; her diet should also be rather
restricted, and light and unstimulating. An occasional seidlitz powder
may also be of service, or a simple injection.</p>

<p><i>Making the Bed.</i>&mdash;It is not customary to disturb the female,
for the purpose of making her bed, till the milk fever is passed; or,
if that does not appear, till the tenth or twelfth day; and then it
should be done with care, and so as not to expose her unnecessarily.</p>

<p><i>First sitting up, and Going out.</i>&mdash;This must of course be
determined more by the condition of the patient, and the state of
the weather, than by any rules. It may be as well to remark however,
no matter how the patient may <em>feel</em>, that the <em>first
attempt</em> should always be made with care. Very frequently she
thinks herself stronger, and more capable, than she really is, and
premature or undue exertion may do great injury. In most cases the
female is allowed to rise within the first week, and sit for a short
time in an arm chair; after which she begins to walk slowly about the
room. The first going out is fixed, <em>by fashion</em>, at one month.
Many females however, are unfit to leave the house till long after that
time, and others should by no means be confined to it <em>so long</em>.
Of course these proceedings should depend, as already remarked, upon
the patient's strength and inclinations, and upon the state<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> of
the weather, and not upon any fashionable observances. Some females
are quite able to rise, and even walk out, in a few days, with benefit
to themselves; and it exhibits as great a want of correct feeling, or
common sense, for any one to make disparaging remarks on them for their
early appearance, as it would if they were to blame the poor invalid
for keeping her bed.</p>

<p>The apartment should be kept constantly <em>well ventilated</em>,
particularly if the female is confined to it, and all soiled linen, or
other sources of foul air, should be removed as quickly as possible.
There is reason to believe that inattention to this, and to properly
cleansing the <em>person</em> of the female, frequently produces
<em>child-bed fever</em>.</p>

<p><i>Attentions to the Child.</i>&mdash;If the infant's bowels are not
opened by the end of the first day it should have a little sugar, or
molasses and water, given to it, and if this does not succeed about
half a tea-spoonful of syrup of Rhubarb may be added. This is however
but seldom needed, if it be put to the breast within a few hours, as
the first secretion of the milk possesses sufficient laxative power
itself. It should also be observed whether it has urinated, and if not
it should be placed in a warm bath immediately.</p>

<p>Some persons prefer to let the child wait till the milk fever is
established, before they let it nurse, but this is very improper. The
early feeding does it no good, and the purgatives it requires are
injurious. As soon as the female is sufficiently reposed, if there is
nothing special to forbid it, the child should go to the breast.</p>

<p>Sometimes the child will remain sleepy and dull, and not seem
to require food at all, for several days, and even die at last of
starvation, unless aroused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255"
id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> If this lethargy continues it should be
put in a warm bath, and afterwards well rubbed, while a little sugar
and water is poured down its throat. These attentions may be required
to be repeated for some time.</p>

<p>About the fourth or fifth day the portion of the cord above the
knot usually separates and falls off, if it has not already done so.
If the navel is inflamed, or suppurates, a little simple ointment may
be rubbed on, and it should be regularly and carefully washed. In some
infants it swells out very much, in which case a pad should be made of
soft linen, and laid upon it, over which the ordinary bandage may be
drawn. The complete healing of the part does not occur till about the
twelfth day, and the bandage must be carefully worn till then at least,
and is better continued a little longer, particularly if there is any
swelling, or if the child cries much, or strains.</p>


<h5>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h5>

<p>From the explanations given above of an ordinary natural labor, it
will be evident that but little manual assistance is required, either
to the mother or the child, and also what really is called for is of
so simple a character as to be easily rendered. It would undoubtedly
be improper, and cruel, to leave females at such times without aid
altogether; but it is also equally improper and injurious to interfere
too much. Excepting in cases of disease and deformity, or of very
unfavorable presentations of the fœtus, Nature herself will nearly
always effect the delivery; and much better, in most cases, when left
to herself. Numerous females and infants have been <em>killed</em>,
and still more have been grievously injured for life, by<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> rude
and uncalled for manipulations; so that it has been a question with
some accoucheurs, of great experience, whether as many would die, or
seriously suffer, from receiving <em>no assistance</em>, as do now from
being improperly handled. Without going so far, it is undoubtedly true
that great mischief is done in this way, which can only be prevented by
both accoucheur and patient bearing in mind that <em>Nature herself is
usually competent</em>, and at most only requires skillful and gentle
<em>assistance</em>. Some practitioners seem to think that labor is a
mere <em>mechanical</em> process, like the removal of a block of stone,
and hence they depend altogether upon <em>force</em>; overlooking
altogether the wonderful vital powers inherent in the system, which
operate with such certainty, and yet so safely; and which frequently
succeed of themselves when brute force is completely foiled.</p>

<p>The nature of the assistance proper to be given, in any particular
stage of labor, will be evident on inspecting the structure of those
parts, of both mother and child, which are brought in connection at
the time, and by considering how their mutual relations require to
be changed and modified. If those relations are already such as are
required, and the system retains sufficient force, nothing <em>can</em>
be done with any advantage&mdash;we must <em>wait</em>, and let Nature
operate herself. Even many unfavorable conditions may be spontaneously
corrected, and it should always be a matter of consideration, when the
means of assistance are not very obvious, whether it will not be better
to rely upon the natural powers than to interfere. Great evil has
resulted from teaching females that labor <em>cannot</em> terminate,
safely, without a great deal of assistance, which can only be rendered
properly by those who possess a vast amount<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> of skill and experience.
They are thus led to think themselves totally dependent upon the
accoucheur, and many of them actually seem to believe that he is as
necessary to deliver the child as a dentist is to extract a bad tooth.
If they were better informed they would feel more confidence in their
own natural powers, and would not be so unnecessarily alarmed when
unforeseen difficulties occur, or when professional aid cannot be
immediately procured.</p>

<p>In most cases there is more danger <em>after the labor is over</em>,
from <em>puerperal fever</em>, various local inflammations and other
causes, than there was during its progress. Indeed the real danger may
be said properly to commence several days after, and the physician is
really needed then more than at the time.</p>

<p class="center">PROTRACTED AND DIFFICULT LABORS.</p>


<p>The causes which may impede a labor, and increase its difficulties,
are numerous, and they are of several different kinds&mdash;some
depending upon the mother, and others upon the child. Some of these
may be easily removed, or modified, but others present more serious
difficulty. It is therefore necessary to enumerate and explain them
separately.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XVIII.</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF PROLONGED LABOR TO BOTH MOTHER AND
CHILD.</h5>


<h5>THE CONSEQUENCES OF PROLONGED LABOR.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">A labor</span> is usually called protracted
or difficult, if the head presents, when it is not completed in
about <em>twenty-four hours</em> from its actual commencement. There
are many labors however, that last much longer, and yet terminate
quite favorably, and many that are over much sooner and yet are very
difficult. Still, generally speaking, the danger and difficulty
increases as the time progresses, and it is seldom prolonged beyond
twenty-four hours without serious inconvenience.</p>

<p>It appears, from the statistics of the Dublin Lying-in Hospital,
that in <em>seventy-eight thousand deliveries</em>, one out of
every <em>ninety-two</em> of the mothers died, and one out of every
<em>eighteen</em> of the children was stillborn. Of those mothers who
were in labor with first children, from <em>thirty to forty hours</em>,
one in every <em>thirty-four</em> died, and one child in every
<em>five</em> was stillborn. Of those who were in labor from forty to
fifty hours, one died in every <em>thirteen</em>. Of those who were in
labor from fifty to sixty hours, one died in every <em>eleven</em>. And
of those who were in labor from sixty to seventy hours, one died in
every <em>eight</em>, and nearly <em>one-half</em> of the children. It
is evident therefore that, as a general rule, the danger increases with
the length of time.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260"
id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<h4>CHAPTER XIX.</h4>

<h5>CAUSES CONNECTED WITH THE MOTHER WHICH MAY IMPEDE LABOR, OR MAKE IT
DIFFICULT.</h5>


<h5>INERTIA, OR WANT OF SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL CONTRACTION
IN THE WOMB.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is most likely to occur in delicate
females, and in those who are debilitated by disease. The contractions
are very feeble, and, as the nurses say <em>do not tell</em>; the mouth
of the womb dilates but slowly, and the head descends with difficulty
into the passage.</p>

<p>In many cases in fact the labor is so tedious, from this cause, that
the female becomes completely worn out, and finally sinks, while the
child is exposed to the greatest hazard from the delay.</p>

<p>It is in these cases that the patient's strength needs supporting,
and that stimulants may be useful. A little wine, or brandy and water,
will often rouse the failing energies, and bring on a series of strong
contractions that will end the labor at once.</p>

<p>The most usual resort however is to the drug called <em>Ergot</em>,
or <em>Secale Cornutum</em>, a fungus growth which is sometimes found
on ears of rye. This possesses the peculiar property of exciting the
womb to contract, the same as an emetic excites the stomach to vomit,
and it seldom fails in its effect; but still there are many objections
to its use. It not unfrequently causes <em>delirium</em>, great
restlessness, and anxiety, sickness, headache, and convulsions, or
complete prostration, from which the female may be long in recovering.
It is also supposed by some to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261"
id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> be not altogether free from danger to
the child. If however no other means were known of making the womb
contract, in such cases, all the probable evils should be risked,
because the labor <em>must</em> be completed at all hazards; but other
means <em>are</em> known, which succeed even more certainly than
ergot, and without any danger. The application of <em>Galvanism</em>,
explained in my "<em>Neuropathy</em>," and "<em>Practical Facts</em>,"
will almost invariably cause the womb to contract, and speedily
bring the labor to a safe termination, without the slightest risk or
inconvenience, to either mother or child. Simple friction over the
abdomen will also succeed in many cases, and gently rubbing the mouth
of the womb with the finger in others. These simple means should
therefore always be used in preference to the ergot, but in case they
cannot be resorted to, or fail, the drug must be administered, and I
will therefore explain the manner in which this is done. When gathered
the ergot is in large irregular lumps, and should be so kept. When
wanted for use a single drachm should be finely powdered, and divided
into three parts; one of these parts to be taken first in a glass of
sugar and water, and the others at intervals of ten minutes, unless the
effects of the first are very powerful. It is often thrown from the
stomach however even in still smaller quantities, and is then given,
by some, as an injection by the rectum, in which mode it seems more
powerful, so that a smaller dose is sufficient.</p>

<p>Great caution should always be observed in using this powerful
drug, as it will sometimes act so energetically as to <em>burst the
womb</em>; or expel the child so suddenly as to lacerate the perineum
and other parts. The contractions produced by it are different
from the natural ones, being almost constant, without any<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
interval, and gradually increasing in force. They usually come on in
about ten or fifteen minutes after the last dose, and continue about
an hour and a half. Some practitioners depend almost altogether on
the ergot, in every protracted case, and even use it to bring on
<em>premature labor</em>, when that is required. Thus M. P. Dubois was
once called to a dwarf, whom he delivered with instruments, the first
time, but with great difficulty and risk. The next time she became
pregnant he determined to bring on premature labor, and accordingly he
administered ergot, when she was about <em>eight months</em> gone. This
brought on natural labor, and she was delivered without difficulty. M.
Chailly says he believes it will bring on uterine contraction at any
time, and that he has never known it to fail. I consider however that
there is always more or less risk in its use, and I should certainly
prefer any of the other means, particularly <em>Galvanism</em>.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance however to be certain, before using
<em>any forcing means whatever</em>, that there is no <em>physical
impediment</em>. If the pelvis should be deformed or small, if the
child's head should be unusually large, or dropsical, or if the soft
parts of the mother should be undilated and rigid, the most serious
consequences must ensue from violent uterine contractions. In like
manner if the presentation be unfavorable, particularly if it be one
of the trunk, the danger is equally great. In every case the passage
of the child must be <em>physically possible</em>, before it is
attempted to force it away. A neglect of this rule has frequently led
to fatal results. The ergot has been given and the uterus forced to
contract, while the pelvis was too small for the child to pass through;
and the consequence has been <em>rupture of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> the uterus</em>, or
complete exhaustion, with death to both mother and infant. In other
cases the delivery has resulted so suddenly, from the violence of the
expulsive efforts, that the vagina and perineum have been lacerated in
the most shocking manner.</p>

<p>The ergot is also especially dangerous to very nervous women, or to
those who are disposed to congestion, apoplexy, or inflammation.</p>

<p>Among the special causes which often paralyze the action of the
womb, may be mentioned a full habit of body, great distention of the
uterus from accumulations of fluid, and extreme thickness of the
membranes. In some cases in fact, the membranes will be so strong
that the most violent contractions fail to break them, and the uterus
completely exhausts itself to no purpose. It is in such cases as these,
when the mouth of the womb is fully dilated, that the accoucheur should
rupture the membranes artificially. This is usually done with the
finger nail by pinching them. Some practitioners however use a pointed
instrument, or a sharp quill; but there is always more or less danger
of injuring the child or the mother by such means. The best time for
breaking them is during a strong pain, when they are fully distended.
The mere scratching, or pushing on them will frequently suffice. I have
known cases however in which they were so strong that an instrument was
actually necessary to open them.</p>

<p>The death of the infant also seems sometimes to check uterine
contraction, though probably not from the mere circumstance of its
being dead, but because the womb suffers from the same morbid cause
which produced its death.</p>

<p>Any strong moral impression may also produce the same state
of things. Thus in some females the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> womb will
instantly cease its contractions, and the labor be arrested, from
<em>fright</em>, or from strong repugnance to somebody, or something,
in the room. Instances have been known of women being so alarmed on
first seeing the accoucheur, or so displeased because he was not the
one they wished, that the uterine efforts immediately ceased, and could
not be again brought on for a long time. The presence of some person
who is a subject of dislike may also have a very prejudicial effect,
and if this is known they should be immediately removed. Dr. Merriman
tells us of a female who was seized with a fit, from which she died,
simply from seeing a strange doctor enter the room.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the cause which paralyzes the action of the womb we
should endeavor, if possible, to discover and remove it. If however
it be beyond our reach, the patient's strength must be supported as
much as possible, and the simplest means of exciting the contractions
tried first; if these fail the more powerful ones must be tried,
always preferring the safest. Finally, if all fail, the hand must be
introduced into the womb, the child turned, and brought away by the
feet; or the forceps must be used if absolutely necessary.</p>


<h5>RIGIDITY OF THE MOUTH OF THE WOMB, VAGINA AND VULVA.</h5>

<p>Sometimes the mouth of the womb or other soft parts, will not give
way, but remain obstinately rigid, so as to render the continued
expulsive efforts of the womb of no avail. If this state continues
too long the parts become swollen, hot, and dry, and extremely
painful, so that the slightest touch causes<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> acute suffering.
The abdomen also becomes exquisitely tender, fever sets in, with
cold sweats, the head begins to wander, the features express great
anxiety and suffering, and the voice alters so that it can scarcely
be recognized. These symptoms will sometimes be established, and
become rapidly worse in a remarkably short time, so that the patient
will appear to pass suddenly from a condition of comparative ease and
safety to one of extreme peril and suffering. The child also suffers
in an equal degree, the continued pressure upon its head having a most
injurious effect. The bones overlap to a great distance, the scalp is
engorged with fluid, and all its blood-vessels are ready to burst;
the brain is severely compressed; the circulation in it is suspended,
and apoplexy frequently ensues. Even when one of these protracted
cases eventually terminates without immediate mischief, there is much
subsequent evil to be feared. The bruised parts frequently slough away,
so that fistulas are formed, and the whole remain so permanently weak
that they can never afterwards retain their places.</p>

<p>The most usual resort in these cases of obstinate rigidity is
<em>blood-letting</em>. This frequently induces relaxation immediately,
and also checks the tendency to inflammation and fever. In many
cases however, if not in all, it may be dispensed with, and should
always be so if possible. Very frequently it produces as much evil
as good, by alarming the patient, and by creating a debility which
cannot afterwards be removed. Simple warm <em>fomentations</em> will
often make the rigid parts give way; and so will lubricating them
with soothing ointment, or better still anointing them with the
<em>Extract of Belladonna</em>. This frequently acts like a charm,
and opens the rigid os<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266"
id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> tincæ in a few minutes. Injections of
thin starch and laudanum are also excellent, and may be advantageously
administered before applying the Belladonna. The <em>Galvanic
Battery</em> may also be employed, it having induced relaxation in many
cases, when all other means failed; as will be seen by the cases quoted
in "Practical Facts."</p>

<p>If the labor really does progress though slowly, it is generally
best to have patience and let it take its course. If however the
patient is likely to sink before it is completed, or if it is at a
stand still, and cannot be accelerated, artificial delivery may be
necessary. It is seldom however that all of the above mentioned means
fail.</p>


<h5>OBLIQUITIES OF THE WOMB.</h5>

<p>Sometimes the womb is so much inclined in a particular direction
that its mouth does not present to the middle of the passage. Thus it
may lean over so much to the right side that the mouth may open against
the left wall of the Pelvis; or it may lean to the left side, or to the
front. In all these cases the expulsion of the child may be totally
prevented, because it is forced against the walls of the passage
instead of down its axis.</p>

<p>Obliquity is sometimes righted spontaneously, but more frequently it
requires the interference of art. The mode of rendering assistance is
to support the womb on the side to which it falls, particularly during
the pains, so that its mouth may be directed towards the middle of the
passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267"
id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>


<h5>PROLAPSUS UTERI.</h5>

<p>Falling of the womb may retard labor, but is not likely to make it
more than usually difficult, nor dangerous. It is requisite, however
to bear in mind that the head of the child may, by this displacement,
be found in the vagina, and even at the vulva, before it has passed
through the mouth of the womb, because the neck itself is already
in the passage. The head may therefore be felt low down, and the
accoucheur may think the labor will soon be completed, when in reality
it has scarcely begun. In such cases it merely requires patience and
<em>non-interference</em>.</p>

<p>In my work on <cite>the Diseases of Women</cite>, will be found
many curious cases of pregnancy and delivery, occurring during partial
or complete prolapsus uteri; and also much information regarding
obliquity, and other similar derangements.</p>


<h5>SMALLNESS OR DEFORMITY OF THE PELVIS.</h5>

<p>These constitute by far the most serious obstacles to delivery,
and are most to be dreaded. In treating upon them it will be first
necessary to explain the chief kinds of deformities, and the cause from
which they arise, after which it can be shown how they interfere with
the progress of labor, and how they can be best remedied.</p>

<p>Deformities of the pelvis may either be congenital, or they may
be produced by certain diseases in after life, and also by bad
physical education. The principal causes however are two diseases,
<em>Rachitis</em>, or <em>Rickets</em>, and <em>Malacosteon</em>,
called also <em>Mollites Ossium</em>, or softening of the
bones. Rachitis usually attacks children somewhere between
nine months and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268"
id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> years of age, and produces a variety
of well marked symptoms; such as large head and belly, protrusion of
the breast-bone, flattening of the ribs, emaciation of the limbs, and
various deformities of the bones. The patient may recover from the
disease, but the deformity of the bones often remains, and therefore no
female should become pregnant, who has had rickets, till the shape and
dimensions of her pelvis are known, or it may cost her life.</p>

<p>Malacosteon or softening of the bones, may come on at any period
of life, and frequently occurs without any serious constitutional
disturbance. It consists in a gradual absorption from the bones of
all their solid matter, so that they become soft, and may be bent or
twisted like horn. Sometimes this state will be reached very soon, but
at other times the disease progresses very slowly. The causes of it
are unknown, and it is incurable. I have seen a patient who could bend
the bone of her leg <em>nearly double</em>, as if it were a piece of
rope.</p>

<p>In my work on the Diseases of Woman, I have spoken upon various
other causes which may deform the bones in young females, such as
wearing corsets, improper attitudes in sitting, and want of sufficient
<em>unconstrained</em> exertion of the body in the open air.</p>

<p>The deformities may be of various kinds, and may either alter the
general appearance and the walk, or may not be discoverable except on
examination. Sometimes the pelvis is <em>too large</em>, so that the
womb and other parts are continually falling down into its cavity, but
this is very rarely seen; more frequently it is either too small, or
irregular in its form.</p>

<p>In all cases where the irregularity in form, or diminution in
size, is such as to prevent the passage<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> of the child an
operation becomes necessary, either upon the mother or her infant, and
great danger is consequently incurred by both.</p>

<p>It is therefore the duty of every mother, if she has the slightest
suspicion that her daughter is deformed, though it may not be apparent,
to have her examined before she is allowed to marry. <em>Many have
lost their lives for want of this precaution.</em> Severe blows or
falls in early life may also create a pelvic deformity, and this, as a
possible consequence of such accidents, should always be borne in mind.
The means by which the form and size of the pelvis are ascertained,
as before stated, are simple, and such as need not in any way be
feared.</p>

<p>To enumerate all the varieties of deformed pelvis, as described
by different authors, is unnecessary, and would not be useful here.
I shall therefore only refer to them generally. Sometimes the pelvis
is regular enough in its form, but singularly small altogether, not
larger perhaps than that of a child eight or nine years of age. More
frequently, however one part only is small, while the others are full
sized, or the different parts are not in a proper position in regard to
each other. Thus sometimes the pubic bones will be flattened backward,
near to the sacrum, so as to narrow the antero posterior diameter of
the upper strait; at other times one of the sides will be flattened
towards the other, as if crushed in, and thus diminish all the
diameters; and at other times one side will sink down lower than the
other, and thus effect similar changes in another way.</p>

<p>By referring to the description of the perfect pelvis, given in the
early part of the work, the nature of these changes will be readily
understood, particularly if the plates given there are compared with
those given here.</p>

<p>Curvature of the spine sometimes affects the pelvis, when low down,
and therefore if any female is affected with it she should not marry
before being examined. Several diseases and lesions of the hip-joint,
and of the thigh, may also do the same, and should therefore be
suspected.</p>

<p>In the great majority of cases, deformities of the pelvis remain
unknown, till the period of delivery, and all that can be then done
is to combat in the best possible way the difficulties they create.
It is evident that the amount of difficulty depends entirely on the
disproportion between the head of the child, and the passage through
which it has to be born. If the head be large and the passage small
the difficulty will be greatest, but if the head be small it may pass
through the pelvis though under its average size. The development of
the head cannot be ascertained however, before birth, except when it is
unusually large from dropsy, and it is therefore always assumed to be
of an average development, and the pelvis is compared accordingly.</p>

<p>The kind of assistance required in these cases depends chiefly on
the measure of the pelvic diameters, though it may be modified somewhat
by other considerations.</p>

<p>When the smallest diameter of the pelvis measures from <em>three
inches and a half to three inches</em>, it is customary to leave the
expulsion of the fœtus to nature, and it is generally effected, though
slowly and with difficulty. If however the patient becomes exhausted,
or the head be unusually large, the forceps are generally used after
waiting five or six hours. In these cases the head often becomes firmly
fixed in the upper strait, so that great force is needed to dislodge
it. The upper part passes through, owing to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> the overlapping of the
bones, and the scalp then bulges out like a large tumor, from being
engorged with blood and serum, but the lower being more unyielding
remains behind. It is therefore impossible for the head to move either
way, as it is formed like a figure 8, and held by the narrow part, as
will be seen by the following plate.</p>

    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>This Plate represents the head fixed, or impacted, at the upper
strait of a narrow pelvis.</p>
  </div>

</div>

<p>When the smallest diameter is not more than from <em>three inches
to two and a half</em>, the birth is sometimes effected by nature,
but with extreme difficulty. The accoucheur waits four or five hours,
as in the former case, and then if no progress is made he applies
the forceps, using great care in doing so. If the extraction is
found impossible, with reasonable force, the head must be opened
and made smaller, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> though the child be living, because it
is more proper to sacrifice it than to risk the life of the mother.
In a case like this however, no one person would like to decide,
unless in a great emergency; there should always be a consultation if
possible.</p>

<p>A <em>dwarf</em>, named Lepratt, who used to perform at the
theatres, was delivered with the forceps by M. Dubois, though the
pelvis only measured <em>three inches</em>. She perfectly recovered,
though the child was born dead: it was of fair average size.</p>

<p>It is contended by some that the delivery may be effected, under
peculiarly favorable circumstances, when the passage measures only two
and a half inches, and at all events the effort should be made; but
for the sake of the mother such cases should not be left long, as the
chance is so small, and the risk of delay so great. When the passage
is <em>less</em> than two and a half inches, spontaneous or artificial
delivery is allowed to be impossible, and the only alternatives then
are to dismember the child or open the mother. Which of these should
be done depends on circumstances. Whenever the child <em>can</em> be
brought away by the natural passages, though it be piecemeal, it always
is so brought, unless the danger to the mother be greater than by the
cesarian operation, in which case that operation is resorted to. By
means of an instrument called the <em>Cephalotribe</em>, which crushes
the head, the child may be brought away, unless very large, when the
pelvis only measures <em>two inches</em>. When the passage is <em>less
than two inches</em>, the only resort is to the cesarean operation,
which sometimes succeeds, and saves both mother and child, though more
frequently the mother sinks.</p>

<p>The necessity for all these frightful operations is now much less
than formerly, <em>and may be done away</em><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> <em>with
altogether</em>. This important fact should be known universally, and
also the means to be resorted to. In the first place, every young
female should be examined, before marriage, by a competent person,
if there be the slightest reason to suspect deformity; and in case
the deformity is found to exist, the consequences if she becomes
pregnant, must be laid before her. If, after being told this, she
<em>will marry</em>, or has already done so, the means of <em>avoiding
conception</em> should be placed at her disposal, so that she may
not be made, of necessity, a helpless victim. These means need not
be described here, though I have no hesitation in referring to them.
When I know that the <em>life</em>, or <em>life-long health</em>, of a
female, depends on her not becoming pregnant, I consider it my duty to
put such means at her disposal, if she desires it. In many instances I
have known females suffer, several times, the most frightful tortures,
merely to bring into the world the mangled fragments of a dismembered
child, with the greatest risk to their own lives; and in others I have
known them in constant dread of becoming pregnant, because they were
conscious it would be their death warrant. In such cases I leave it
to <em>humanity</em>, and <em>common sense</em>, as to whether such
information should be withheld? <em>I</em> could not reconcile it with
my notions of <em>duty</em> to withhold it.</p>

<p>In case pregnancy has occurred before the deformity is discovered,
and it is then found that a <em>full grown</em> child cannot be
born, premature delivery must be brought on; or, in other words, the
Uterus must be made to expel the child before the full term, while
it is yet small enough to pass through the Pelvis. This operation
is of course only allowable when needed to preserve life, or to
escape great suffering and danger. It must always be decided<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> upon
by the medical man, and performed by him, so that a description of it
is uncalled for here. In Europe it is quite common, and nothing has
tended so much to do away with those disgusting and horrid operations,
on mother and child, which were formerly absolutely necessary in cases
of deformity. If it is found at the first delivery of a female, or
before, that she cannot bear a living child at full term, artificial
delivery is accomplished at <em>seven</em> or <em>eight</em> months,
thus avoiding all the danger to the mother, and <em>frequently
preserving the child</em>. In the case of the <em>dwarf</em> before
referred to, when she became pregnant the second time, M. Dubois
brought on premature delivery, and the child was <em>born alive</em>,
with but little difficulty. According to statistics it appears that,
when artificial premature delivery has been induced, in <em>one hundred
and sixty-one cases</em> only <em>eight mothers</em> have died, and all
but <em>forty-six</em> of the infants were born alive. Of the whole
number of children <em>seventy-three</em> continued to live; and of the
eight mothers five died from other causes, leaving but <em>three</em>
whose death resulted from the operation. Now when the fearful number of
deaths from instruments, and other operations, necessary at full term,
is recollected, the advantage of this practice will be evident. In the
Cesarian operation for instance, which is often the only remaining
resort, but <em>one</em> female out of <em>six</em> recovers.</p>

<p>The delivery should be postponed as long as possible, so as to give
the best chance for the child living. This must of course be decided
upon after the size of the pelvis is ascertained. Seven months is the
earliest time at which the fœtus is viable, and it is much better
left till eight, if the size of the parts will allow of its birth
then. In case they are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286"
id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> small that it cannot be born even at
seven months, we have our choice, as M. Chailly remarks, <em>between
the dreadful Cesarian operation at full term, and producing early
miscarriage</em>.</p>

<p>M. Dubois seems to recommend premature delivery in nearly all cases,
if the smallest diameter is <em>under three inches</em>; because, as
he remarks, spontaneous delivery at <em>full term</em> is then a very
rare exception, and the danger and suffering to the mother is so great.
He also recommends it when there are tumors, and even when the female
is afflicted with any acute disease. Of course it is always necessary,
before operating, to be sure that the child is alive.</p>

<p>I knew a lady myself who had given birth, at full term, to
<em>seven</em> children, all of which were torn from her with
instruments, <em>dead</em>, owing to the smallness of the pelvis. When
pregnant with the <em>eighth</em>, premature delivery was brought
on, at my suggestion, at about <em>seven months and a half</em>. The
fœtus was born with comparative ease, and <em>lived</em>. But for this
operation she probably would never have been blessed with a living
child at all. Since then she has avoided conception.</p>


<h5>TUMORS IN THE PELVIS.</h5>

<p>Tumors of various kinds are met with, both in the bones of the
pelvis and attached to the soft parts. They frequently offer the
most serious impediments to delivery, and baffle the skill of the
most experienced obstetricians. In fact they differ so much in their
structure, their size, and their situation, that but few general
directions can be given as to their management. In every case where
one exists pregnancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287"
id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> should never occur, if possible to
be prevented, before it is removed; for though it may cause no
inconvenience at other times, yet during delivery it may necessitate
very serious operations, or even cause death. Some of these tumors
are mere vesicles, or bags, filled with fluid, and may be punctured
and their contents let out, so as to make them less. Others are more
or less solid but moveable, and may often be supported above the
upper strait till after the child is born. When they are so large as
to block up the passage, and are either fixed or cannot be carried
up into the Womb, there is often no other choice than to either cut
them out or open the child's head; the practice being determined by
the circumstances of the case. In some instances the bladder itself,
distended with urine, has impeded delivery, and been mistaken for a
tumor; and in other instances stones in the bladder have caused the
same error.</p>

<p>A specimen of one of these tumors is represented in Plate XLVII, and
one of a Polypus in Plate XLVIII.</p>

a case myself, in which the labor was completely arrested by a large
hard tumor about the middle of the Vagina; it could not be moved, and
delivery was evidently impossible while it remained. In consultation it
was decided to cut it out, as there seemed but little circulation of
blood in it, and its situation was favorable for the operation. This
was accordingly done with but little trouble, and the child was born
without difficulty in about twenty minutes after. The mother perfectly
recovered.</p>

<h5>TUMORS EXTERNALLY.</h5>

<p>Sometimes tumors exist externally, on the lips, or in the Vulva,
but as they seldom offer much obstruction, and are easily detected and
managed, but little need be said about them. They should always however
be attended to, if discovered, before labor comes on, or better still
before pregnancy.</p>

<p>In some instances the veins around the Vulva become much enlarged,
and resemble tumors, and sometimes even impede delivery. It is usual
then to open them, and let out the blood, but not till the head is
sufficiently low to press upon it and prevent dangerous bleeding.</p>


<h5>OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE VAGINA, AND NARROWNESS OR OBSTINATE RESISTANCE
OF THE VULVA AND PERINEUM.</h5>

<p>The Vagina may be partly closed by its sides growing together, or
it may be united by bands and membranes stretching across; and these
obstructions may be sufficient to impede or prevent delivery. Most
usually they give way, and are gradually broken down by the pressure
of the child's head; but if they prove too strong, after waiting a
reasonable time, they must be cut through. Cases have even been known
in which the <em>hymen</em> has been found perfect at delivery, and
even offered considerable resistance, so as to necessitate its being
cut through before the child could be born. In such cases this membrane
is unusually strong, and conception occurs without its being broken.</p>

<p>When the perineum or Vulva remains rigid and hard, so that the
opening cannot be enlarged sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> for the child to pass,
it may also be necessary to operate with the knife. But this should
never be done till after every means of relaxation has been tried, and
the head has been kept back as long as prudent. It is however, always
better to open a passage than to let one be <em>torn</em>, because it
may be made in the most favorable place. When the perineum is allowed
to be torn, the most serious consequences often ensue, and the patient
is made a miserable sufferer for life. The Vagina and Rectum may be
torn into one, or the power of retaining the contents of the intestine,
or bladder, may be for ever lost. When an incision is made none of
these evils follow; the wound speedily heals, and in a little time no
trace of it can be seen. It has even been necessary <em>to cut the
neck of the Womb</em>, when it would not open, to prevent the organ
from being ruptured; and this has been done with perfect safety. A
celebrated practitioner in this city had to perform such an operation
very recently, on a female who had injured herself, and made the mouth
of the Womb grow together, by violent attempts to produce abortion. The
delivery took place with comparative ease, and no unpleasant results
whatever followed, either to the mother or the child.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XX.</h4>

<h5>CAUSES CONNECTED WITH THE CHILD, OR CHILDREN, WHICH MAY IMPEDE
DELIVERY, OR MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS.</h5>


<h5>PROCIDENTIA OF THE UMBILICAL CORD.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> means the escape of a portion of
the cord before the child itself. It is most frequent in the irregular
presentations, as they do not so fully close up the mouth of the Womb,
and it is most likely to occur at the commencement of labor, though
not impossible at a later stage. Very often the cord descends when the
membranes break, being carried down by the rush of the waters; and
sometimes it is already in the sack, or bag, before the rupture takes
place. This accident is comparatively frequent, being found to occur as
often as once in about three hundred cases.</p>

<p>The causes which produce procidentia of the cord, are most likely
these:&mdash;A large quantity of liquor amnii, and its sudden
discharge,&mdash;Unnatural presentations,&mdash;Deformities of the
superior strait of the Pelvis,&mdash;A very long cord,&mdash;and
rupturing the membranes too early. But it may also happen from other
causes with which we are unacquainted.</p>

<p>There is seldom much difficulty in detecting this accident,
because if the membranes are broken it protrudes into the Vagina,
and if they remain whole it can be felt within the sack, and
its pulsation will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298"
id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> be quite distinct. Sometimes, it is
true, it may be so firmly compressed, between the fœtus and the walls
of the pelvis, that its pulsation may be very indistinct, or even
totally suspended for a time; but this only necessitates a little extra
care.</p>

<p>Procidentia of the cord may be very serious for the child; in fact,
it is a frequent cause of its death. The reason of this will be evident
when the functions of the cord are borne in mind. The circulation in it
is as necessary for the life of the child before birth, as breathing is
after, and when protruded first it can seldom escape being so pressed
upon as to stop its circulation, and hence the danger. To the mother
it makes no difference whatever, unless it be told and alarm her; or
unless violent efforts are made to correct it. She had therefore better
not know if it occurs.</p>

<p>If assistance is not rendered in this accident the consequences are
almost always fatal to the child, though in some instances the cord has
remained hanging from the Vulva several inches, for an hour or more,
and still the infant has been saved.</p>

<p>If the fallen cord is detected before the membranes are broken, it
may frequently be put back into the Womb without much difficulty. The
accoucheur must wait till the mouth of the Womb is fully dilated, and
then watch his opportunity, in an interval between two contractions,
to push the cord upwards, between the fœtus and the uterine walls. If
he succeeds in this, as is usually the case, he must then break the
membranes during the next pain, and this will bring the presenting
part at once into the upper strait, and so block up the passage.
To effect this manœuvre it is requisite to introduce two or three
fingers, and sometimes even the whole hand. It<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> must never be attempted
till the mouth is fully dilated, otherwise the membranes may be
ruptured too soon, and the delivery be delayed, thus increasing the
danger.</p>

<p>After the rupture of the membranes the replacing of the cord becomes
a much more difficult matter, and frequently cannot be effected at all;
particularly if the head be descended far down. Every effort however
must be made, and if unsuccessful the delivery should be hastened as
much as possible. In many such cases the <em>forceps</em> are applied,
and the child brought away at once, because every moment's delay
increases the risk to its life.</p>

<p>Several different kinds of instruments have been invented to return
the cord, but they are seldom at hand when needed, and none of them are
so good as the hand itself.</p>

<p>If the return of the cord cannot be effected, and the progress
of the labor will allow of it, the hand is introduced and the child
turned, unless the position of the head will allow of the advantageous
application of the forceps, in which case they are mostly resorted
to. The only general rule is, to terminate the labor as speedily as
possible, consistent with the welfare of the mother. In spite of all
that can be done the pulsation is often found to cease, and when the
child is born it is either quite dead or breathes but a few times.</p>

<p>A very frequent indication that the fœtus suffers from compression
of the cord, is a greenish color of the water discharged, owing to the
discharge of <em>Meconium</em> from the child's bowels. This is brought
about, most probably, by its straining, and its efforts to relieve
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300"
id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>


<h5>SHORTNESS OF THE CORD.</h5>

<p>The cord is sometimes too short, and this may operate very
unfavorably in many ways. It may keep the fœtus up in the Womb, and
prevent it from descending to the bottom of the Vagina,&mdash;it may
cause the placenta to be torn away too soon, and so lead to serious
flooding,&mdash;it may pull down and invert the Womb,&mdash;or it may
make the labor very tedious, and cause the death of the child.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are but few signs of this accident, even after
the rupture of the membranes, and none at all before, that can be
depended upon. If the head has descended properly, and the parts be
fully relaxed, but still the expulsion is delayed from no obvious
cause, it may reasonably be supposed that shortness of the cord exists;
and if so there is very soon given a proof of it by a discharge of
blood. This is owing either to the breaking of the cord, or to the
separation of the placenta, and is frequently the first intimation
the assistant has of the accident. All that can be then done is, to
conclude the delivery as soon as possible, and in the best way that
circumstances will allow.</p>

<p>In some cases the cord is not too short absolutely, but is made
so by being twined round the body or limbs of the child, which are
often <em>cut off</em> by it. M. Tasil saw a case where the cord round
the neck had nearly severed the head; and Montgomery gives several
instances in which the limbs had been amputated in this way. Two of
these are represented below:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301"

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="center"><i>Limbs cut off by the Cord.</i></p>

<p>Occasionally the cord can be slipped over the head, or limbs,
when wound round them, and the strain upon it be thus removed. If
this cannot be done however, and the danger increases, relief may be
obtained by <em>cutting the cord</em>, particularly if it be absolutely
short. But this must not be done till everything indicates that the
labor will probably soon terminate; and the end connected with the
child must be carefully held, or tied.</p>

  </div>
</div>


<h5>DESCENT OF OTHER PARTS WITH THE HEAD.</h5>

<p><i>One Arm.</i>&mdash;The descent of one arm along with the head may
cause some delay and difficulty, but Nature nearly always overcomes the
impediment. It is seldom that the arm can be reduced, and therefore
but little can be done at first; if the delivery be evidently arrested
by it the accoucheur must at last assist in the most feasible manner.
Sometimes even it is necessary for him to apply the forceps.</p>

<p><i>The Two Arms.</i>&mdash;Even this difficulty is often<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
overcome spontaneously, though much more rarely than the former one. As
soon as it is detected, the accoucheur must endeavor to return one or
both of the limbs, if the labor has not proceeded too far; and if he
cannot succeed the delivery must be accomplished as soon as possible,
either by turning or with the forceps, unless there be reasonable
ground for delay.</p>

<p><i>The Feet.</i>&mdash;Either one or both of the feet may also descend
with the head, at first, though they usually recede and allow the head
to be born alone. When they are so impacted as to prevent the delivery
being completed, the accoucheur must interfere. In most cases he will
find it quite easy to push the feet above the head, and allow that to
descend alone; but if this is not possible he must introduce one hand,
grasp the feet with it, and pull them down, while the other pushes the
head up. This will turn the child, and if it be in no immediate danger,
and the mother is not suffering, the rest may be left to nature; but if
the contrary is the case, the delivery must be finished as speedily as
possible. When the head is very low down it may be necessary to use the
forceps, but great care must be observed not to grasp the feet along
with the head when using them.</p>

<p><i>A Foot and Arm.</i>&mdash;The proceeding is the same as with the foot
alone. If the limbs cannot be returned the head and arm must be pushed
up, while the foot is brought down.</p>


<h5>TWINS AND TRIPLETS.</h5>

<p>In most cases where there are two or more children the delivery
is easier than with one, because they are generally small, and the
first one so prepares the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303"
id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> way that the rest are born without
difficulty. It is also a fact that twins are nearly always born before
full term, and consequently are not quite grown.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the second fœtus usually takes place, immediately
after the first, though sometimes the Womb stops contracting, and it
is not born for half an hour or more, and it may even remain for hours
or days. It is a question whether, in such a case, the second delivery
should be left for Nature to finish, or whether the accoucheur should
terminate it sooner artificially. The most general practice is to wait
only about half an hour, and then, if the Womb is still inert, use
friction, or other necessary means, to excite it, and accomplish the
second delivery as soon as possible. If there be more than two the
proceeding is still the same.</p>

<p>Some difficulties may arise however with twins, which it is
necessary to be prepared for. Thus the two heads may come together,
and mutually impede each other. In this case the one which moves the
easiest must be pushed up till the other is descended sufficiently
low. One head may also descend with one or two feet; in which case, if
the feet cannot be returned, the head must be pushed up, and they must
be brought down. The force exerted however, must not be very great at
first, because <em>one may belong to each of the children</em>, and
much injury may be done; a little gentle traction will soon detect
this however, with ordinary care. If two arms, or one arm and a foot
descend, the same care is also required, before pulling upon them,
to ascertain that they are not parts of the <em>two</em> children.
Sometimes when the head of one twin descends along with the feet of the
other they may, if small, descend together. But if this is impossible,
and interference is needed, we must first<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> try to push up the head;
and if this cannot be done, <em>it</em> must be drawn upon, not the
feet; because if the feet were drawn down the two children would soon
occupy the passage together, body and head, and would perhaps become
firmly wedged. In nearly every case one of the twins presents by the
head and the other by the feet, as formerly shown.</p>


<h5>EXCESSIVE SIZE OF THE FŒTUS, OR THE DISEASED DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN
PARTS.</h5>

<p><i>Fœtus too large.</i>&mdash;It is very rarely the case that the Fœtus
is so large as not to pass easily through a well-formed Pelvis, though
such cases have been known. The mode of proceeding is of course
precisely the same as if the pelvis were too small. If no means will
succeed in abstracting the Fœtus whole, it must be made less; but
Nature should be first allowed full time to act with all her force.</p>

<p><i>Hydrocephalus.</i>&mdash;This consists of an accumulation of water in
the head of the child, and is usually termed watery head. The bones
of the cranium will sometimes be widely separated by it, and the head
be made so large that it cannot possibly be born till made less. The
causes which produce this disease before birth are unknown.</p>

<p>In cases of hydrocephalus the head does not descend into the
straits, owing to its size, and is felt to be full and firm, during a
pain, but soft and yielding during the intervals, especially at the
fontanelles and sutures, which are also very large. The bones are
usually very wide asunder, or even totally separated, as if floating in
the fluid.</p>

<p>In some cases, when the quantity of fluid is but small, the delivery
may terminate spontaneously;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305"
id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> the head lengthening, from being so
soft, and thus adapting itself to the size and form of the strait. Most
frequently however, assistance is rendered in such cases, either by the
forceps, which will sometimes succeed, or by puncturing the head, and
letting out the fluid. This operation has been performed and the child
saved, though such an occurrence can never be reasonably anticipated.
Such instances however, show that great care should be taken not to
injure the brain, as that would destroy the small chance there is.</p>

<p>Dropsy may also occur in the chest, or abdomen of the child,
causing similar difficulty with dropsy of the head. If the natural or
artificial expulsion of the child cannot be effected without, the part
must be carefully punctured, and the fluid evacuated.</p>

<p><i>Tumors on the Fœtus.</i>&mdash;Sometimes various kinds of tumors
form on the child's body, but they are rarely so large as to prevent
delivery, though they may delay it. If they should be too large
however, it will be necessary to remove them, as in the case of tumors
in the Pelvis.</p>


<h5>OSSIFICATION OF THE HEAD.</h5>

<p>Occasionally the bones of the head will be so hard, and so closely
united, that they will not overlap, in which case the labor may be
very difficult, unless the head is small, or the pelvis very large.
If after waiting a reasonable time, there be no prospect of the
labor terminating naturally, and the female is exhausted, it must be
terminated artificially, as if it were a case of deformed pelvis. It is
seldom however, that the head does not eventually give way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306"
id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>


<h5>VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE FŒTUS, FROM WHICH THE
LABOR MAY BE DIFFICULT OR PROTRACTED.</h5>

<p><i>Presentations of the Face.</i>&mdash;These are usually more difficult,
and longer, than those of the head. They will nearly always however,
terminate spontaneously, or with ordinary assistance; but, if they
should not, artificial delivery must be practised, either by turning,
if the case be not too far advanced, or with the forceps. Some of
the most celebrated authors recommend that all these cases should be
treated like cases of natural labor. Dr. Merriman says that in some
<em>very favorable</em> instances turning may be practised with safety
and advantage; but Dr. Lee says, "My firm belief is, that the child,
even under such favorable circumstances, would have a far better chance
to be born alive if the labor were left wholly to Nature; or, if the
natural powers were inadequate, to be extracted with the forceps."
In such cases there is often too little patience, and too much
interference.</p>

<p><i>The forehead inclined against the Pubes.</i>&mdash;In this position
the labor may be long delayed, and difficult, and most practitioners
endeavor to turn the head round, if they cannot bring down the feet,
or else apply the forceps at once. Dr. Lee however remarks, and very
properly, "From all that I have seen of these cases, I am disposed to
believe that it is best to leave them to the natural efforts, and to
avoid all interference, all attempts to change the position, while the
pains continue regular, and the head advances, however slowly." If the
labor does not progress at all, or the female becomes exhausted, of
course artificial delivery is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307"
id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Several <em>varieties</em> of head and face presentations may
also retard labor considerably, but Nature nearly always overcomes
the difficulty; or if she cannot do so mere ordinary assistance is
required.</p>


<h5>PRESENTATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.</h5>

<p>It has already been remarked, in another place, that breech
presentations mostly terminate spontaneously, and that but few of them
require interference. In some of them even, when the pelvis is large,
or the fœtus small, the delivery is effected quite rapidly. Still such
presentation occasionally causes delay and difficulty, and necessitate
more or less assistance.</p>

<p>As soon as the mouth of the Womb is opened sufficiently, unless
the labor is rapidly progressing without it, one of the fingers may
be introduced and <em>hooked</em> over the groin, and a little gentle
force exerted upon it. This will assist very much, and will often be
all sufficient. If the pelvis is too small, or the fœtus too large,
and the delivery is evidently arrested, the breech must be pushed up,
if possible, and the feet be brought down, as in turning. The remarks
of Dr. Lee on this presentation are so plain and practical, and marked
with such good sense, that I think a better explanation of what should
be done in such cases-could hardly be given, I will therefore quote his
remarks in full:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Having ascertained that the nates present, whatever the position
of the fœtus may be, whether the abdomen look backward or forward,
we cannot alter it with safety, and no change can be required to be
made till the nates and lower extremities are expelled. The os uteri
dilates slowly in most cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308"
id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> of nates presentation, but we cannot
employ any means with advantage to accelerate the delivery, and in
most cases, if we do not interfere, but wait patiently, they are
gradually pressed lower and lower into the pelvis, and at last escape
from the vagina without any assistance. If the os uteri and vagina
are imperfectly dilated, and the nates are drawn down or pass rapidly
through the pelvis, the child is often lost. The membranes should not
be ruptured, and the expulsion of the nates should be left entirely
to the natural efforts, unless the labor is protracted and exhaustion
takes place. Except supporting the perineum, nothing is required in a
great proportion of these cases before the nates and lower extremities
have been expelled, when it becomes necessary to ascertain precisely
the relative position of the child to the pelvis, to rectify this if
it is unfavorable, and artificially extract the superior extremities
and head, to prevent the fatal compression of the umbilical cord. If
we find, after the expulsion of the nates and lower extremities, that
the toes are directed forward, or that the child is in the position
represented in the second figure, with its abdomen applied to the
anterior part of the uterus, and that its back lies along the spine
of the mother, we should wrap the nates and sides in a soft napkin,
and turn the child very gently round during a pain, observing to which
side the feet are inclined to turn, till its abdomen is to the spine
of the mother, and the toes are directed backward to the hollow of
the sacrum, or to the side of the pelvis. In many cases the nates
turn round in the passage spontaneously, so that it is not required
artificially to alter the position. It is necessary always to recollect
that it is possible to turn the body of the child round without
turning the face round into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> the hollow of the sacrum, and that the
chin may be over the symphysis pubis when the front of the chest and
abdomen are turned backward. After the lower extremities and body
of the child have been expelled, and placed in the most favorable
position for the extraction of the superior extremities and head, it
is necessary to proceed without loss of time to draw these through
the pelvis, that the child may not be destroyed by compression of the
umbilical cord. As pressure upon the cord for a very short time will in
some cases kill the child, it is proper to watch closely the pulsations
of its arteries. Draw the body of the child forward as far as the
arm-pits, and place it over the palm of your right hand and fore-arm,
and gently draw the body towards the left thigh of the mother; then
pass the fore and middle fingers of your left hand along the back part
of the left arm of the child to the elbow-joint, and press down the
arm with your lingers along the thorax of the child, and extract it.
Then transfer the body of the child and left arm to your left hand and
fore-arm for support, and with the fore and middle fingers of your
right hand disengage and bring down, in the same way, the right arm of
the child; then pass the fore and middle fingers of your left hand into
the mouth of the child, or rather over the lower and upper jaw, and at
the same time place the fore and middle fingers of your right hand over
the back part of the neck and occiput, and with the fingers of the two
hands thus applied extract the head, in the line of the axis of the
pelvis. The perineum is very rigid in some cases of nates presentation,
where it is the first child, and it will be torn if the head is
extracted hastily, and not drawn forward to the symphysis pubis. When
you feel the pulsations of the cord beginning to cease, you may<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> be
tempted to employ greater extracting force than the neck of the child
and perineum can bear, and both may be destroyed. The only method of
obviating this is to press back the edge of the perineum, that the air
may gain admission into the mouth of the child, and the respiration
go on, when the circulation in the cord has been arrested, until the
perineum is sufficiently dilated to slide back over the face, and allow
the head to pass. I have seen from twenty minutes to half an hour
elapse in some cases, after the cord had ceased to pulsate, before
the perineum would allow the head to escape, during which time the
respiration was regularly performed. This is not a new practice; it has
been alluded to by some of the older accoucheurs, and some others; and
the advantages to be derived from it were fully pointed out some years
ago by Dr. Bigelow, in a paper published in the American Journal of the
Medical Sciences, 'On the means of affording Respiration to Children
in Reversed Presentations.' The object of Dr. Bigelow in this paper
is to show that in many cases the life of the child may be saved by
forming a communication between the mouth and atmosphere previous to
the delivery of the head. If the head be low down, the fingers alone
can give the necessary assistance; but if it is high in the pelvis, and
is reached with difficulty, the assistance of a tube may be necessary.
He recommends a flat tube, which is to be guarded, and kept within the
fingers of the inserted hand.</p>

<p>"Where the pelvis of the mother is small or distorted, and the
child large and unfavorably situated, the efforts of nature may be
insufficient to expel the child, either alive or dead. The nates
may become so firmly impacted in the pelvis, that they cannot<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
advance without artificial assistance. A finger should be passed up to
one of the groins, and when a pain comes on a considerable extracting
force may be exerted with it, without injuring the child; or a soft
handkerchief may be passed between the thigh and abdomen, and the
nates drawn down; but this cannot be done unless they have descended
low into the cavity of the pelvis. Where these means fail, and it is
impossible to extract the child alive, the blunt hook or crotchet
must be employed. In cases of nates presentation, where the pelvis
is distorted, after the extraction of the trunk and extremities, it
is necessary to perforate the back part of the head, and complete
the delivery with the crotchet. In presentations of the feet and
knees the treatment does not essentially differ from that required in
presentations of the nates."</p>

</div>


<h5>PRESENTATIONS OF THE SHOULDER.</h5>

<p>These are the most dangerous of all the presentations, and most
frequently require assistance; in fact the delivery can seldom be
terminated naturally when the shoulder presents.</p>

<p>Sometimes the child will pass doubled up, as formerly explained, but
this must not be too confidently expected. Dr. Lee says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is now a general rule, established in all countries where
midwifery is understood, that in cases of preternatural labor, where
the shoulder and superior extremities of the child present, the
operation of turning ought to be performed. But the hand must not
be forced into the uterus, if the orifice is rigid and undilatable;
it should be dilated nearly to the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> size of half-a-dollar
piece or more, or the margin ought to be very thin, soft, and yielding,
if it is expanded to a smaller extent than this when turning is
attempted. If the os uteri will not admit the extremities of the
fingers and thumb in a conical form to be introduced without much
force, if it is thick, hard, and unyielding, some delay is necessary,
that the parts may relax, death being almost always the consequence of
thrusting the hand with violence through the orifice of the uterus in
a rigid and undilatable condition, whether the membranes be ruptured
or not. But as soon as it will admit of the safe introduction of the
hand, where you have ascertained that an arm presents, no time should
be lost in completing the delivery, otherwise the membranes may give
way, the liquor amnii be evacuated, and a case of little difficulty and
danger be suddenly converted into one equally hazardous to the mother
and child. In all cases of labor, where the first stage is far advanced
without the nature of the presentation being positively determined, or
a superior extremity is felt through the membranes, the patient should
be kept in the horizontal position, that they may not be ruptured;
and you should remain in constant attendance upon the patient, and be
prepared to interfere the instant the necessity arises."</p>

</div>

<p>Speaking of the operation of turning in these cases he remarks as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In some favorable cases of shoulder and arm presentation, the
uterus is widely dilated before the membranes are ruptured and
the liquor amnii discharged; and no difficulty is experienced in
passing the hand into the uterus, laying hold of the feet, and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
extracting the child by the operation of turning. If the uterus is
not contracting strongly and at short intervals, little resistance
is offered to the introduction of the hand, and the delivery may be
speedily accomplished with safety both to the mother and child. But if
the membranes have burst, the liquor amnii escaped, and the uterus has
been contracting firmly upon the child many hours before the operation
of turning is attempted, the child is often destroyed by the pressure,
and the coats of the uterus exposed to great danger from contusion
and laceration in passing up the hand and bringing down the feet. The
shoulder and thorax become so strongly impacted in the pelvis, that
great force is required to introduce the hand to grasp the feet, and
much exertion necessary before the position can be changed.</p>

<p>"In other cases of shoulder and arm presentation, the membranes
burst and the liquor amnii escapes at the commencement of labor,
and the os uteri is rigid and undilated, so that the hand cannot be
passed into the uterus after the labor has continued many hours. The
difficulty and danger of these cases is greatly increased when the
uterus is contracting with violence, and the pelvis is distorted, or
a disproportion exists between the child and pelvis from any
other cause. The greater number of women, if abandoned to the efforts
of nature under these circumstances&mdash;the uterus having no power to
alter the position of the fœtus&mdash;would ultimately die undelivered,
from exhaustion or rupture of the uterus and vagina."</p>

</div>

<p>Fortunately these cases are very rare, and when assistance is
rendered <em>early</em>, the difficulty is readily overcome. This is a
strong reason why all women especially should know what to do, because
a little timely help may save much suffering, or even life.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXI.</h4>

<h5>UTERINE HEMORRHAGE, OR FLOODING, DURING LABOR.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is always a troublesome, and
frequently a fatal accident. It should be always watched for, and
attended to as early as possible&mdash;<em>a few minutes</em>
frequently determining the recovery or death of the patient.</p>

<p>The chief causes of flooding are, the too early or violent,
separation of the placenta; insertion of the placenta over the mouth or
on the neck of the womb; laceration of the womb or vagina; the bursting
of a swelled vein; rupture of one or more of the blood vessels of the
uterus; and breaking of the cord.</p>

<p>Probably the most frequent of these causes are the premature or
violent separation of the cord, and the bursting of the blood vessels.
The insertion of the placenta over the mouth of the womb, instead of
on the fundus, occurs very seldom, but when it does severe flooding is
nearly certain to follow, because the placenta has then to be torn,
by the expansion of the parts, at the very commencement of the labor,
and probably continues to pour out blood for a long time before the
child is delivered, and it can be expelled. In fact this occurrence,
unless the labor terminates very speedily, is nearly always fatal to
the mother, and frequently to the child also. In most cases there is
more or less hemorrhage from this cause during gestation, particularly
after the sixth month, when the neck of the uterus begins to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
enlarge more than the placenta, and consequently tears away from it.
Abortion frequently results also, if the flooding be not stopped.
Madame Boivin tells us that in <em>twenty thousand three hundred and
fifty-seven</em> deliveries there were but <em>eight</em> cases in
which the placenta grew over the mouth of the womb; which is equal
to <em>one</em> case in every <em>two thousand five hundred and
fifty-four</em>. Dr. Churchill has collected the accounts of <em>one
hundred and seventy-four cases</em> of this kind, and he finds that out
of these forty-eight terminated fatally; or nearly <em>one out of every
three</em>.</p>

<p>The rupture of the blood vessels may occur when they are too much
engorged with blood, or when their coats are weakened and corroded
by disease. Shortness of the cord may also produce a rupture of the
vessels, by the strain it causes on them and on the membranes.</p>

<p>In many cases the flooding comes on suddenly, without any warning
whatever, though most usually it is preceded by a sensation of
weight, heat, and fluttering in the pelvis, pains in the thighs and
back, flushed face, headache, and dizziness. The pulse also becomes
irregular, the hands and feet grow cold, and the ears often ring, or
buzz. The only certain sign that the hemorrhage has really commenced
is the appearance of the blood itself, and this often occurs, as
previously remarked, without any premonitory sign whatever.</p>

<p>The danger from hemorrhage during labor is greatest when it
commences the earliest, because it has then the longest to last.
From any of the causes mentioned it is evident that it must continue
till delivery is accomplished, and therefore if it appears at the
commencement of the labor it may cause the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span> death of both mother
and child, before the labor can be terminated. The danger is greatest
however to the child, unless the flow be very profuse indeed, and then
it is equally so to both. After delivery the danger is of course only
to the mother; and the rapidity with which it may compromise her life
is in some cases fearful. Dr. Lee thus speaks of such cases.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"But one of the most dangerous varieties of uterine hemorrhage is
that which follows the expulsion of the placenta, or its removal from
the uterus by art. Sometimes the blood escapes in great quantities
from the uterus immediately after the removal of the placenta, and
the pulse ceases at the wrist, and consciousness is entirely lost in
a few seconds. There is no symptom before labor has commenced, or
during its progress, to warn you of what is about to take place. The
child has been safely delivered, the placenta has come away in a short
time, and while you are perhaps congratulating yourself on the happy
termination of the labor the blood begins to trickle over the bed upon
the floor, or the patient suddenly complains of great faintness. In
such cases there may be either a want of uterine contraction, or the
contractions may not be permanent, but be followed by relaxation and
the effusion of a large quantity of blood, which may either appear
externally, or remain to become coagulated, and distend the uterus. For
several hours after delivery, in some cases, this alternate relaxation
and contraction goes on, to the great hazard of the patient, and if
her condition be not clearly ascertained, and the proper remedies be
employed, death may unexpectedly take place."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318"
id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the treatment, he gives such excellent and practical
rules, that I cannot do better than quote them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"By far the most important remedies in these cases of uterine
hemorrhage are constant and powerful pressure over the fundus uteri,
the application of cold around the pelvis, and the free administration
of wine, brandy, and other stimulants: ergot is indicated, but it most
frequently produces no effect. The pressure and cold are always within
our reach, however sudden the attack may be. The hypogastrium should
be strongly compressed with the binder, and a pad of folded napkins
placed under it, and in addition the hand should be firmly applied
over the fundus uteri. I do not know who it was that first employed
compression of the fundus uteri in cases of flooding after the birth
of the child; but it has been often recommended, and there are few
practitioners in this country who are not fully aware of the importance
of the binder and pad, in exciting permanent and regular uterine
contractions. Dr. M'Keevor states, that in 1815 it was recommended
by Dr. Labatt in his lectures, and for a number of years before this
Dr. Labatt was accustomed to recommend a thick firm pad, or compress
over the pubes, previous to the application of the ordinary binder,
where, in former labors, uterine hemorrhage had taken place. Dr.
M'Keevor states, that of 6665 women delivered during the years 1819
and 1820, only 25 were attacked with hemorrhage after the birth of the
child. Of these, 15 occurred before the expulsion of the placenta,
ten afterwards, and in all the results was favorable. He saw only
two fatal cases during the time he was in the Dublin Lying-in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Hospital, and he attributes this small mortality partly to the process
of parturition being left entirely to the unassisted gradual efforts
of the uterus; partly to the patient having been kept cool and quiet,
free from all sources of disturbance and irritation; but, above all, to
the careful application of the binder immediately after delivery, by
which means the expulsion of the placenta, and permanent contractions
of the uterus, are most effectually secured, and whenever any tendency
to hemorrhage did occur before the removal of the placenta, the first
point invariably attended to was to tighten the binder, and in the
event of this not succeeding, a thick firm compress, made by folding
a couple of large coarse napkins into a square form, was placed over
the region of the uterus, and the binder again adjusted. In the great
majority of instances, these, with the admission of cool air, checked
the discharge; if not sufficient, additional pressure was made with the
hands.</p>

<p>"At the same time that you efficiently compress the fundus uteri
with the binder and pad, cold should be vigorously applied to excite
the contractions of the uterus. The best mode of doing this is to
plunge a large napkin in a pitcher of cold water, and dash it suddenly
against the external parts, the nates and thighs; and this should be
repeated till the uterus contracts, and the violence of the hemorrhage
is controlled. I am satisfied that this is the most efficacious method
of applying cold to excite uterine contractions; it is far less
formidable than pouring water from a height over the naked abdomen, but
it is not less efficacious, and it possesses these decided advantages
over the other method, that while the application is made to the
external parts, nates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320"
id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> thighs, the pressure of the binder and
pad is not withdrawn from the hypogastrium, the position of the patient
is not changed from the side to the back, the bed is not inundated with
water, and the application can be repeated as often, and continued as
long, as the urgency of the symptoms may require. The abdomen may be
exposed once, and cold water poured over it from a height, and the
uterus made to contract, and the flow of blood be arrested for a time,
but relaxation of the uterus may follow after a short interval, and
the hemorrhage be renewed again with equal violence as at first; but
we cannot with propriety expose the abdomen a second time, and empty
over it from a height the contents of a great decanter or kettle.
Besides, by adopting this practice, we sacrifice the whole of the
effects derived from pressure on the fundus uteri. The application of
a napkin soaked in vinegar and water to the parts is often sufficient,
along with the binder, to restrain the hemorrhage where it is not very
profuse.</p>

<p>"I have very seldom introduced a plug of any kind into the vagina
in these cases, but when there has been a draining of blood from the
uterus, after the practice now described has been employed, a large
soft sponge passed into the vagina, and pressed up against the os
uteri, has appeared in some cases to promote the coagulation of the
blood. The sponge, however, cannot be employed with safety after the
expulsion of the child and placenta, unless the uterus be firmly
compressed above the brim of the pelvis to prevent its becoming
distended with blood. More frequently I have had recourse with good
effect, to the introduction of several pieces of smooth ice into the
upper part of the vagina, and allowing them to remain there, in contact
with the os uteri, and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321"
id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> dissolved, or pieces of ice have been
inclosed in a bladder and laid over the pubes.</p>

<p>"Other means besides those now described have been recommended in
cases of flooding after the expulsion of the placenta. It has been
proposed to inject cold water into the cavity of the uterus by means
of the stomach pump, and favorable reports have been given of the
practice. The effect, I think, would be similar to directing forcibly a
stream of cold water against a stump soon after amputation; the coagula
in the cavity of the uterus and in the orifices of the vessels would
be all washed away: nevertheless, it might perhaps be advantageous in
some desperate cases. Port wine and water, as cold as possible, Dr.
Collins says, injected into the rectum, has been of service. Some of
the earlier writers on midwifery, and many in the present century, have
strongly recommended the introduction of the hand within the uterus for
the purpose of removing the coagula accumulated within the cavity, and
to excite the uterus to contract. But it is not necessary to pass the
hand into the uterus for the removal of coagula, because if the binder
has been properly applied, and strong pressure made over the fundus
uteri, clots cannot accumulate within the uterus, and if they have been
permitted to collect in consequence of neglect, then expulsion will
immediately follow the use of proper compression of the hypogastrium,
without the introduction of the hand. Nor do I consider it necessary,
to excite uterine contractions, that the hand should ever be introduced
into the cavity of the uterus after the removal of the placenta. I
am fully convinced, from repeated observation, that this practice,
which is so common as to be almost universal in this country at<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the present time, is often not only ineffectual for the purpose, in
the worst cases of flooding, but that it is often followed by the
most pernicious effects; the coagula which nature has formed have
been displaced by the hand, and the uterus has not been excited by
the stimulus of it to secure a permanent contraction. In the greater
number of fatal cases of uterine hemorrhage after the expulsion of
the placenta, which have come under my observation, the hand had been
introduced into the cavity, and the closed fist had been pressed for
a longer or shorter time round and round against the lining membrane,
to make the uterus contract. I do not recollect a single fatal case,
where the unfortunate result could be fairly attributed to the want
of the introduction of the hand into the cavity of the uterus, and
the friction of the knuckles against the lining membrane. I have
repeatedly passed the hand into the uterus to produce contraction,
but it has refused to obey the stimulus of the hand; it has remained
like a soft flaccid bag, more like a piece of intestine than uterus,
and the blood has continued to pour down the arm, until the hand has
been withdrawn, and more efficient remedies employed. Leroux was well
aware that the stimulus of the hand would not in all cases excite the
uterus to contract, for he observes, "where the os uteri is contracted,
the means indicated by Levret are very efficacious, and remove the
hemorrhage as if by a charm. But it is not so in complete inertia of
the uterus; often it is widely dilated, and offers no resistance to
the introduction of the hand. The introduction even of the whole hand
excites little sensation, and the woman will promptly perish from
hemorrhage if other means more active and certain are not employed
to prevent it." The tampon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323"
id="Page_323">[323]</a></span> or plug is the remedy Leroux recommends
in cases of flooding after delivery, and he affirms that it will often
succeed in stopping the flow of blood when all other means fail. Dr.
Dewees observes, that he has not found it necessary to introduce the
hand for the purpose of stopping an hemorrhage after the expulsion of
the placenta, during the last five-and-thirty years, as he regarded
the practice as always frightful, and oftentimes unnecessary and
pernicious. But it is difficult to subvert an established mode of
practice, however unsound, and probably some of you, without much
reflection, because you have heard this recommended, will pass up the
hand into the cavity of the uterus after the expulsion of the placenta,
on the very first occasion that you have an opportunity of doing so,
remove all the coagula, and rub the inner surface with the fist till
you are tired, without effect. I have seen cases repeatedly where this
has been diligently performed by those who had neglected to apply the
pad and binder, and all the other means now described. If you pass the
hand at all within the parts, which I strongly suspect you will do, let
me entreat you to carry it no farther than the os uteri, which you may,
with much less risk and with greater effect, press and rub with the
fingers and irritate than the inner surface of the body and fundus of
the uterus.</p>

<p>"Mauriceau recommends that women who are subject to flooding after
delivery should be bled twice or thrice from the arm during pregnancy,
and once, or oftener, after labor has commenced. There are cases of
uterine hemorrhage after the delivery of the child and expulsion of the
placenta unconnected altogether with the plethora, or an excited state
of the heart and arteries, and where bleeding<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> and low diet do not
prevent the accident. Rupturing the membranes at the very commencement
of labor is by far the best remedy, the only thing indeed upon which
any dependance can be placed.</p>

<p>"After attacks of uterine hemorrhage, the patient should not be
raised from the horizontal position for several hours, and the strength
should be supported by wine, beef-tea, and light nourishment. Brandy
in gruel sometimes agrees when wine is rejected. A good large dose of
the liquor opii sedativus often produces the most decided benefit after
the hemorrhage has ceased; there are few cases before this in which
opium does good, though it is constantly given in all the varieties of
flooding, even when the great object is to excite uterine action. Where
recovery is to take place after uterine hemorrhage, says Dr. M. Hall,
the pallor of the countenance, the disposition to syncope, the coldness
of the extremities, the feeble state of the pulse, and uninterrupted
respiration, pass gradually away. Where the case is to terminate
fatally, the symptoms gradually assume a more alarming aspect, the
countenance becomes pale and sunk, the respiration stertorous, and
the pulse cannot be felt at the wrist. There is great restlessness,
and before death one or more fits of convulsions sometimes occur.
Where recovery takes place, in some women it is astonishing how little
permanent inconvenience is felt from the great loss of blood which they
have sustained. In the course of ten days or a fortnight the effects
have entirely disappeared; and this is the most common result. In some
women, a violent determination of blood takes place to the brain,
marked by heat, strong pulsations of the carotid and temporal arteries,
intolerance of light, and all the symptoms of inflammation of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
brain or its membranes. A strong febrile attack is also sometimes
experienced, without an increased determination of blood to any
particular organ. These affections of the brain and nervous system are
aggravated by depletion. The patient should be kept in a cool, dark
room, and mild cathartics, anodynes, and antispasmodics, occasionally
given. Where there is much headache and throbbing, a few leeches should
be applied to the temples, and a cold lotion to the scalp."</p>

</div>

<p>These remarks of Dr. Lee, as to bleeding frequently making the after
symptoms worse, should be carefully borne in mind. There is no doubt
but that too copious, or too frequent bleeding, during pregnancy or
labor, disposes the female to many serious dangers afterwards. I have
known some suffer constant headache, dizziness, and loss of memory, for
weeks after from it; and others have even been made light headed.</p>

<p>To the above remedies I would only append one other, which has,
on many occasions succeeded, when all others have failed, namely
<em>Galvanism</em>. This has, at the last moment, when the female was
sinking, brought on uterine contractions, stopped the flooding, and
saved her life. The application is very simple; one pole being placed
on the back, immediately between the hips, and the other over the
uterus. Or one of the poles may be coated with wax, all but the end,
and introduced into the vagina, so that the unwaxed part may touch the
mouth of the womb, while the other is placed over the fundus, or on
the back, as found most efficient. The power should be sufficiently
strong to produce contraction, and the application must be continued
till the contraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326"
id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> remains after the pole is withdrawn. No
medical man should give any female up who is flooding, no matter how
severely, till he has tried Galvanism. In my "<em>Neuropathy</em>" and
"<em>Practical Facts</em>" will be found many cases, with such plain
directions that any one could follow them and apply it.</p>

<p>The presentation of the placenta, or its growth over the mouth of
the womb, is the most serious cause of flooding, and generally makes
any attempt to check it of no avail, except <em>delivery</em>. The
discharge however nearly always occurs before the full period, and
either causes miscarriage or necessitates premature delivery. Dr. Lee
remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the greater number of cases of placental presentation the
discharge of blood takes place spontaneously in the seventh and
eighth months of pregnancy, and cannot be referred either to bodily
exertion, external violence, nor to any unusual determination to
the uterine organs, or congestion of their vessels. The hemorrhage
generally comes on suddenly, when the woman is in a state of rest,
and the blood continues to flow until faintness or even syncope
takes place. It often ceases entirely, and the patient resumes her
usual occupations, and has no dread of another attack. But after
an interval of several days, and sometimes not before two or three
weeks, the flooding is renewed, and perhaps with increased violence,
or a constant profuse discharge takes place, and a decided effect is
produced upon the constitution,&mdash;the pulse becomes rapid and
feeble, and the countenance pale. Similar attacks return at longer
or shorter intervals, and if delivery be not accomplished by art,
sooner or later death takes place. The first attack of flooding
seldom proves fatal, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327"
id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> it sometimes does so; for in the second
case related in the table, which occurred in the British Lying-in
Hospital, the life of the patient was at once extinguished by a single
gush of blood from the uterus. I examined the body after death. The
centre of the placenta was over the centre of the os uteri.</p>

<p>"When flooding takes place to an alarming extent in the seventh or
eighth months of gestation, you ought first to ascertain, by a careful
internal examination, whether or not the placenta be situated at the
os uteri. It is impossible, from the manner in which the discharge of
blood takes place, to be certain of the fact; for there are some cases
of hemorrhage from detachment of the placenta from the upper part of
the uterus, where the flooding occurs spontaneously, and to as great
an extent as in cases where the placenta presents. In some cases I
have been induced, from the symptoms, to believe that the placenta was
at the os uteri when it was not. As the treatment and the successful
or fatal result of the case will, in a great measure, depend on the
correctness of the diagnosis, the examination should be conducted with
so much care and circumspection as to leave no room for doubt on the
subject. An ordinary examination, with the fore and middle fingers, is
generally sufficient to enable us to ascertain the true state of the
case, but where the os uteri is very high up, and directed backwards,
it becomes requisite to introduce the whole hand within the vagina.
The finger should then be passed gently through the os uteri, and,
if the placenta adheres to the cervix, it will be distinguished from
coagulated blood, the only substance with which it can be confounded,
by its firmer, fibrous, vascular structure, and, above all, by its
adhering at one part to the uterus, and being<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> separated at another. If
you will take the trouble to pass the finger carefully and repeatedly
over the uterine surface of a recently expelled placenta, you will
never, in actual practice, mistake a placenta at the os uteri for a
clot of blood, however firm. In all cases it is requisite to proceed
at once to determine by an examination, so carefully conducted
as to render a mistake impossible, whether or not the placenta
presents&mdash;even though the hemorrhage should be slightly renewed
by the displacement of the coagula; you cannot be too early acquainted
with the precise condition of the patient. You ought, at the same time,
to ascertain whether the placenta adheres partially or completely to
the cervix uteri, and whether the os uteri is in a condition to admit
of the operation of turning being performed.</p>

<p>"The operation of turning, which is required in all cases of
complete placental presentation, is not necessary in the greater
number of cases in which the edge of the placenta passing into the
membranes can be distinctly felt through the os uteri. Sometimes
there is profuse and dangerous hemorrhage where the placenta does
not adhere all round to the neck of the uterus, but only partially.
If the os uteri is not much dilated or dilatable, the best practice
in these cases is to rupture the membranes, to excite the uterus to
contract vigorously, by the binder, ergot, and all other means, and to
leave the case to nature: by adopting this treatment the operation of
turning may be avoided with advantage in the greater number of cases of
partial placental presentation. But, if the hemorrhage is profuse, has
returned at different intervals, and a great quantity has been lost,
and the constitution is really affected, it is the safest practice at
once, if the orifice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329"
id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> uterus is in a condition to allow the
hand to pass without difficulty, to deliver by turning the child.</p>

<p>"Where the placental presentation is complete, the operation of
turning should be performed, in all cases, as soon as the orifice of
the uterus is so much dilated or dilatable as to allow the hand to be
introduced without the employment of much force. It is seldom safe to
attempt to deliver by turning before the os uteri is so far dilated
that you can easily introduce the points of the four fingers and thumb
within it: however soft and relaxed it may be, until dilatation has
commenced, and proceeded so far, I am convinced there are very few
cases in which the operation of turning will be required, or completed
without the risk of inflicting some injury on the os uteri. This is a
point of the greatest practical importance, but I do not know in what
manner to communicate to you, in words, a more clear and definite idea
of the grounds upon which you ought to proceed.</p>

<p>"In every case, before attempting to turn, make a most careful
examination of the os uteri, and endeavor, from the degree of
dilatation, and the thinness and softness of the orifice, to form
a correct judgment upon this point, before interfering, for the
hemorrhage will be renewed if the attempt is unsuccessful, and the
patient will be placed in a worse condition than she was before. When
you have resolved to turn, let the patient lie on the left side, with
the pelvis close to the edge of the bed, and introduce the right
hand into the vagina as before described, and then pass the fingers
and hand gently and slowly in a conical form through the os uteri,
giving it time to dilate, and onward into the cavity between the
detached portion of the placenta and the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> uterus: then force
the fingers through the membranes, grasp both feet, and bring them
down into the vagina, and <em>slowly</em> extract the child as in
the cases of nates presentation, and do not afterwards be in a hurry
to remove the placenta, unless it is wholly detached and lying in
the upper part of the vagina. This operation is easily and speedily
performed when the os uteri is widely dilated and dilatable. It is,
however, a great exaggeration of the facility with which turning may
be accomplished in these cases, to represent it as a very simple
process&mdash;like putting the hand into the coat-pocket and pulling
out your handkerchief. At the best it is a dangerous operation, and you
can never tell with certainty whether or not the patient will recover
after its performance, however easily it may have been effected.</p>

<p>"But there is not unfrequently most profuse and alarming flooding
from complete placental presentation, where the os uteri is so thick,
rigid, and undilatable, that it is impossible to introduce the hand
into the uterus without producing certain mischief. In thirteen out
of thirty-six recorded cases the os uteri was rigid and undilatable.
The tampon or plug has no power to restrain the hemorrhage in such
cases, nor do I know of any other means&mdash;either cold, quietness,
or opium&mdash;which effectually have, and it is sometimes absolutely
necessary under such circumstances to deliver by turning, before the
hand can possibly be introduced into the uterus without producing
fatal contusion or laceration of the part. I have found in several of
these cases, however, that the delivery may be safely accomplished by
merely passing the hand into the vagina, and afterwards the fore and
middle fingers between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331"
id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> uterus and detached portion of the
placenta, grasping with them the feet, which are generally situated
near the os uteri, and drawing down the inferior extremities into the
vagina, and delivering. I know that the inferior extremities may often
be brought down in this way where it is impossible to pass the whole
hand through the os uteri."</p>

</div>

<p>The same state of things may however result from other causes, and
a very different mode of proceeding may then be needed, as the doctor
very clearly shows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Flooding may take place in the latter months of pregnancy, and
during labor, where the placenta does not adhere to the neck of
the uterus, but to the body or the fundus, and is detached by some
external or internal cause. The separation of the placenta from the
upper part of the uterus may be produced by violence, as blows, falls,
pressure over the hypogastrium, and shocks of various kinds; but it
arises much more frequently from internal causes, of which morbid
states of the placenta, and twisting of the umbilical cord once or
oftener round the neck of the child, are the most common and obvious.
This variety of hemorrhage, though usually termed accidental, can
rarely, however, be referred to accident. Sometimes the flooding
occurs to a great extent without any assignable cause; a large
portion of the whole of the placenta, when in a healthy condition,
being suddenly detached from the uterus, when the patient has been
exposed to no external accident, or injury of any kind, and when
no symptoms of increased determination of blood to the uterus have
preceded the attack. When this happens a large<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> quantity of blood is
poured out between the placenta and uterus, a small portion of which
only at the time usually escapes from the vagina, to indicate what is
going on within the uterus. There may be a great internal hemorrhage,
accompanied with the ordinary constitutional effects resulting from
loss of blood&mdash;as faintness, sickness, or vomiting, coldness of
the extremities, rapid feeble pulse, hurried breathing; when there is
little or no discharge from the vagina to excite alarm, or to point
out the source of danger, when it is extreme. It is from the general
symptoms of exhaustion, and by the disagreeable sense of uneasiness,
weight, or distension of the uterus, experienced, and not from the
quantity of blood which appears externally in these cases, that we are
led to discover the true state of the patient&mdash;to suspect that
internal hemorrhage is going on. But much more frequently only a small
portion of the placenta is at first detached, and the greater part of
the blood which is extravasated between it and the uterus separates
the membranes, and descends by its weight to the orifice, and escapes
through the vagina. In all cases, however, of uterine hemorrhage in
the latter months, the danger cannot be so accurately estimated by
the quantity of blood which appears externally, as by the general
symptoms. The portion of placenta which is detached, never re-unites to
the uterus, but when expelled it is usually seen covered with a dark
coagulum adhering to the uterine surface.</p>

<p>"When the blood escapes in small quantity, and there are no labor
pains present, and no disposition in the os uteri to dilate, and
the constitutional powers are not impaired, an attempt should be
made to prevent a return of the discharge, and the occurrence<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> of
labor pains. For this purpose, if the pulse is full and frequent,
some blood may be taken from the arm, and the patient should be kept
in the horizontal position, surrounded by cool air, cold applications
made over the hypogastrium, and acetate of lead and opium, mineral
acids, and other remedies that diminish the force of the circulation
and promote the coagulation of the blood, should be taken internally.
The plug is here totally inadmissible; it can only convert an external
into an internal hemorrhage. But where the flooding occurs at first
profusely, and is renewed even in a moderate degree, in spite of our
efforts to check it, the continuance of pregnancy to the full period
cannot be expected; it will be of no avail to bleed and administer
internal remedies, except for the purpose of checking the discharge,
and thus averting the immediate danger until the uterus is emptied of
its contents.</p>

<p>"The operation of turning, which is required in all cases of
complete placental presentation, is rarely necessary in uterine
hemorrhage where the membranes are felt at the orifice. In a great
proportion of these cases, where, on making an examination, you can
feel the smooth membranes extending across the neck of the uterus,
the flooding will be arrested, and the labor safely completed, if the
membranes are ruptured, the liquor amnii discharged, and contractions
of the uterus excited by gentle dilatation of the orifice, and other
appropriate means. The only cases in which this treatment fails are
those in which it has not been had recourse to sufficiently early, or
where the whole or a large portion of the placenta has been suddenly
separated from the uterus, and a great internal hemorrhage has taken
place. The uterus will not contract effectually in these cases<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
after the membranes have been ruptured; the pains, instead of becoming
stronger, become more and more feeble, return at longer intervals,
and during these the blood flows more profusely, and death would take
place before delivery, if the child were not extracted by the forceps,
crotchet, or by the operation of turning. In all cases, then, of
uterine hemorrhage in the latter months of pregnancy, and in the first
stage of labor, where the placenta does not present, and the quantity
of blood discharged is so great as to render delivery necessary, where
it appears improbable that the pregnancy can go on longer with safety,
or to the end of the ninth month, rupture of the membrane with the
nail of the forefinger of the right hand, evacuate the liquor amnii by
holding up the head of the child, dilate very gently the os uteri with
the fore and middle fingers expanded, and occasionally make pressure
with the fingers around the whole orifice; apply the binder, give ergot
and stimulants, and the uterus will, in all probability, contract upon
its contents, and expel them without further trouble. If the hemorrhage
should, however, continue after the employment of these means, delivery
must be accomplished by the forceps, craniotomy, or by turning,
according to the peculiarities of the case. In women who are liable
to attacks of flooding after the expulsion of the child or placenta,
rupture the membranes at the commencement of labor, even before the os
uteri is much dilated, if the presentation is natural, and you will
often succeed in entirely preventing hemorrhage."</p>

</div>

<p>The recommendation to bleed may be with good reason objected
to, at least in the great majority of such cases; and I cannot
but think that a timely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335"
id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> and persevering use of the ordinary
remedies, namely, keeping quiet, using acid drinks, and cold
fomentations to the abdomen, would do away with any necessity for it at
all. I question very much if ever bleeding really prevented abortion
from flooding, and I cannot but think that it has often brought it on
sooner. Nevertheless, if all other means fail to arrest the discharge,
and there are no decided objections to the contrary, it might be
cautiously tried; though the policy of taking <em>more</em> blood
from a person who is already losing <em>too much</em>, is not very
evident.</p>

<p>I have often known the most severe flooding stopped, merely by
the female lying on her back, drinking plentifully of lemonade, and
applying cold wet cloths over the abdomen. A small dose of laudanum
occasionally is also useful; and complete rest and tranquillity of
<em>mind</em> is as indispensable as rest of the body. Many females
flood and miscarry merely from worrying and fretting themselves, and
from passion, or strong excitement, <em>particularly of a certain
kind</em>. This in short must be carefully avoided, and the patient
must live strictly as if a widow.</p>

<p>This accident is likely to occur in subsequent pregnancies, at
nearly the same time, and should therefore be guarded against by a
careful avoidance of all excitement, or violent bodily exertion,
during the whole time. Keeping the bowels gently open, and practising
a regular diet, are also requisite. A good supporting bandage is also
of frequent service. For much more valuable information on this subject
however, I refer to my work on "<cite>The Diseases of Women</cite>," in
which it is fully treated.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXII.</h4>

<h5>ECLAMPSIA, OR CONVULSIONS DURING LABOR.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">Convulsions</span> are to be looked upon as
very serious indications of derangement, during either pregnancy or
labor, and are frequently followed by fatal results to both mother and
child. They may be of several different kinds, <em>epileptic</em>,
<em>hysteric</em>, or <em>cataleptic</em>, though the epileptic form
is most common. They often occur during pregnancy, but not usually
before the seventh month, though occasionally met with much earlier.
According to observations it appears that there is not above one case
of convulsions in six hundred deliveries.</p>

<p>The principal cause of this disease appears to be the strong
sympathy between the womb and other organs, owing to which they are
continually disturbed by the changes it undergoes. Certain temperaments
also dispose to it, particularly the lymphatic, and also dropsy,
rickets, and other diseases. Strong moral impressions may also have a
predisposing effect, such as sudden frights, joy or anger, and also
acute pain, or the dread of it.</p>

<p>In most cases, and particularly during pregnancy, the convulsions
are preceded, and indicated, by severe headache, and spasm at the
stomach, with dimness of sight, bright sparks before the eyes, buzzing
in the ears, and partial difficulty in speaking. Occasionally however
the fit comes on quite suddenly, without any warning whatever.</p>

<p>There are few exhibitions of suffering more frightful than one
of these attacks, and none that call for<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> more prompt and decided
action. In general females are perfectly helpless when one is attacked
in this way, and instead of being able and disposed to render proper
assistance, they either run away alarmed, or fall into hysterics
themselves. It is however of the utmost consequence that the sufferer
should be attended to instantly, and therefore every female should
know what to do in such an emergency, at least till better aid can
arrive.</p>

<p>At the first commencement of convulsions the features become
gradually fixed, the eyes are expanded and distorted, the breath is
drawn with difficulty, and all consciousness appears to cease. The
body then begins to twitch, the mouth opens, usually on one side, the
tongue protrudes, the head turns on one side, and the blood rushes to
it and the face in great quantities. In a short time the jaws close
again with great force, and the tongue is bitten if proper care has
not been taken to prevent it. At last the eyes began to twinkle, the
mouth moves as if the patient were muttering, and the nostrils expand;
the arms are thrust straight down by the sides of the body, with the
hands firmly closed; the legs are stiffened straight out, and the
body is bent back like a bow. In short every muscle is affected with
spasms, which are sometimes fearfully violent, and may endure for a
considerable time. When they subside, the fit gradually terminates and
passes off. During the whole time the breathing is difficult, the mouth
froths very much, and the heart palpitates quickly, but irregularly.
When the spasm is over the patient falls into a perfect stupor,
during which she remains unconscious, but with all the limbs soft and
moveable, except the fingers, which appear to grasp. The jaws generally
remain closed, and so do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338"
id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> eyes, but they may be easily opened, and
will sometimes remain open; the breathing becomes powerful and loud,
and the pulse beats with rapidity. At last slight motions are observed,
and consciousness gradually returns, but the memory is generally gone
for some time. This state of stupor usually lasts from ten minutes to
half an hour, but has been known to continue for many hours, or even
a whole day. The spasm seldom continues more than from one to ten
minutes, though it has lasted for an hour or more.</p>

<p>These convulsions might be mistaken for ordinary hysteria by those
not acquainted with the difference. In hysteria however the female
moves about and struggles more; she also cries out, and retains both
sensibility and consciousness, so perfectly even sometimes that
she requests those around to hold her, which is never the case in
convulsions.</p>

<p>During the stupor it might be supposed, by any one not aware of
the previous fit, that the patient was suffering from apoplexy, or
intoxication, the appearance being so similar to that exhibited in
those states. This shows the necessity for careful inquiries as to what
has previously occurred.</p>

<p>During pregnancy convulsions generally cause abortion, either
by bringing on uterine contractions or by causing the death of the
child. Some few patients have suffered from them however, and yet
gone their full time, but this must never be expected. A gradual
extinction of the vital spark, during the stupor is the ordinary
termination, though sudden death is not unfrequent, during the fit.
Gradual recovery is occasionally witnessed, but seldom without partial
loss of memory, or some other affliction. Madame Lachapelle says that
<em>one-half</em> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339"
id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> females attacked with convulsions die,
and of their children many more.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the <em>tendency</em> to this fearful
affliction may be very much lessened in many females, by proper
attention to diet and regimen. Those who are of a full habit, and
disposed to headache, and rush of blood to the head, should live low,
and carefully avoid everything of a heating or stimulating character,
and also every kind of excitement or agitation. The bowels should
be kept free, and the skin well rubbed and kept warm, and the head
cool.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;While the patient is in the fit, care must
be taken that she does not fall off the bed, or bite her tongue,
to prevent which the jaws must be kept apart, by putting something
between, as a piece of soft wood, or the handle of a spoon covered with
cloth, or even a knotted napkin. The face should be sprinkled with
cold water, and the whole body well chafed, particularly the hands and
feet, which should also be made warm as soon as possible. As soon as
the spasm is over it is customary to bleed, either at the arm, or by
leeches to the temples and behind the ears. Mustard poultices should
also be applied to the feet, and inside the thighs, and an enema should
be given of warm water and a table-spoonful of salt. Ice, or cold
water, should be applied to the head constantly, and if possible the
body should be immersed in a hot bath, which will, in many instances,
bring the patient round immediately without any other treatment.
The bladder should be also looked to, as well as the bowels, and if
necessary the catheter should be used. As soon as she can swallow a few
drops of laudanum may be given, or a little ether, but not a full dose
by any means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340"
id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The propriety of bleeding, even in these cases, is denied by many,
and I am almost inclined to think myself, that a prompt and persevering
use of the other remedies mentioned, would be fully as successful
without it. At all events, the fearful mortality in spite of it
proves that it has not much power, and may well raise a doubt of its
utility.</p>

<p>Convulsions however are so fearful and violent, that few
practitioners can resist the temptation to bleed, because it seems
so well calculated to give prompt relief; and besides it has popular
prejudice in its favor. Some authors however assert that it makes the
danger greater of paralysis, and loss of memory, afterwards.</p>

<p>When convulsions occur during pregnancy they seldom cease entirely
till the uterus is emptied of its contents. It is therefore necessary
to bring on labor, and terminate it as soon as possible, after the
parts are in a proper condition. When they occur during labor it must
also be finished in the shortest time possible, to afford the best
chance of saving the child, and also because no treatment will prevent
the attack while the patient remains undelivered. All means of bringing
on dilatation of the mouth of the womb, mentioned in the article on
<em>Rigidity</em>, may be resorted to, excepting <em>Ergot</em>, which
should never be used in these cases.</p>

<p>M. Chailly tells us, that in thirteen cases of convulsions
<em>nine</em> were first pregnancies, and <em>seven</em> of the females
were dropsical. Only <em>one</em> was attacked during pregnancy,
<em>ten</em> while in labor, and <em>two</em> after. Only <em>two</em>
died, and <em>ten</em> of the children.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that where pregnant females have had
convulsions, apparently from living too high, the children have also
had them after delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341"

<h4>CHAPTER XXIII.</h4>

<h5>RUPTURE OF THE WOMB OR VAGINA.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">Rupture</span> of the womb arises from various
causes, but most usually from powerful contractions when the pelvis
is small, or the fœtus large, or when it presents unfavorably. It
not unfrequently results also from force being used, particularly
with <em>instruments</em>. In fact there is no doubt but that
<em>numerous</em> females die from this accident, brought on by the
violence, haste, and want of skill of their attendants. Few injuries
are more serious, or more beyond the reach of any remedy than this,
though it is sometimes suffered with impunity.</p>

<p>The symptoms of rupture of the womb are strongly marked, and
fearfully evident. When it occurs, which is most usually during a
powerful contraction, the female shrieks, and instantly complains of
an agonizing pain over the seat of the rupture; her face grows deadly
pale, her pulse falls, and she faints. In general <em>death</em> is
almost instantaneous, though sometimes life may be preserved for an
hour or two, but very seldom. There have even been cases of recovery,
but they are very few, and regarded almost as miracles.</p>

<p>In most cases, directly the rupture happens the fœtus escapes
through the rent into the abdomen, and most of the fluid with it;
but sometimes it still remains in the womb, and then if the liquor
amnii is discharged there may little or nothing pass through the
opening, and the danger will be much lessened<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> in consequence. In all
cases the only proceeding which offers any chance of recovery is,
<em>to deliver as soon as possible</em>, because when the fœtus is
expelled the uterus begins to contract, so as to close the wound, and
when that is effected, if but little fluid has passed into the cavity
of the abdomen, all may yet go well. It may frequently happen, when the
hand is passed into the womb, to turn and deliver, that nothing can be
found, the fœtus having passed through the opening into the abdominal
cavity, in which case the hand must be passed through the opening also,
and the fœtus be brought back if possible. If however the rent is too
much closed, or the child cannot be reached, the <em>Cesarean</em>
operation is the only resort.</p>

<p>M. P. Dubois tells us of a case of this kind which occurred in his
own practice. The female had only been in labor about an hour when she
uttered a piercing cry, and sank as if suddenly mortally wounded. The
head of the child, which was previously at the mouth of the womb, could
not be felt, and on introducing his hand M. Dubois found its feet were
passed through the opening into the mother's abdomen; he brought them
back however, and effected delivery by turning with comparative ease.
Strange to say this woman was discharged <em>cured</em>, in fifteen
days after, though the uterus was so torn that the intestines had
forced themselves through the opening into its cavity, and M. D. put
them back with his hand, which also passed clear into the peritoneal
cavity. In all cases, after the delivery is effected, the womb should
be again explored, so that if any parts have come through they may be
returned before the opening closes, which it may do very soon.</p>

<p>Cases are even mentioned where the child passed clear out of
the womb into the abdominal cavity, and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> remained there till
absorbed, or escaped through a fistulous opening many years after;
while the wound healed up, and otherwise the patient perfectly
recovered. Recovery however, in any way, is a rare occurrence.</p>

<p>Some females seem more disposed to this accident than others;
possibly from a peculiar tenderness in the substance of the womb. All
are however liable to it, and this liability should beget a proper
caution in all manipulations, and forbid uncalled for violence in any
way.</p>

<p>Rupture of the vagina is much less serious than rupture of the womb,
unless it occurs at the upper part, when it may give rise to similar
symptoms and results. At the lower part the danger is much less, though
still sufficient to excite apprehension.</p>

<p>The treatment is the same as in the former case. Delivery must be
effected as soon as possible, and the patient kept still and cool to
avoid inflammation.</p>

<p><i>It is generally thought that the greater part of these accidents
result from improper treatment, and particularly from using
instruments.</i></p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXIV.</h4>

<h5>OPERATIONS WITH INSTRUMENTS.</h5>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> use of instruments in effecting
delivery is a last resort to save life, and ought to be intrusted
only to persons of skill; it may therefore be thought unnecessary to
treat of them in the present work, and indeed I should not have done
so but for the purpose of satisfying the natural curiosity of females
themselves. The greater part of the dread they now experience where
instruments are needed, arises from ignorance of their nature and mode
of action. At the present time nearly all the instruments used, in
competent hands, are comparatively safe and harmless, and if females
generally understood how they operated, much less fear would be excited
by their use. Years ago, when cutting and tearing instruments were
employed, in nearly every case of difficulty, the lamentable results
which followed fully justified the fears experienced, but at the
present day such things are seldom seen, except in medical museums, the
same purpose being much better effected by simpler and more harmless
apparatus. I wish therefore simply to give a brief explanation of the
structure, and mode of action, of the instruments now chiefly employed,
and to show the extent of their application and the results which have
followed from it.</p>


<h5>THE FORCEPS.</h5>

<p>The forceps are intended to take hold of the fœtus, and assist us
to draw it into the world when the natural<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> forces are inadequate,
and no hold can be obtained by the hands. They were first invented
about the year 1650, by an English surgeon named Chamberlin, who
made a secret of his invention and realized a large fortune from it.
Since that time they have been modified in various ways, by different
practitioners, but still remain essentially the same as when first
used.</p>

<p>The most usual form, and probably the best, is that represented
below:</p>

<div class="plate-inline">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="center">PLATE L.</p>
  </div>

     <img src="images/i_p0346sm.png" width="284" height="300" alt="forceps" />
    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="caption">

    <p>It consists of two blades articulated by a button, or screw joint,
so that they can be easily separated and again adjusted,&mdash;Fig. 1.
Each blade is cut out in the middle, and curved, as seen in Fig. 2.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347"
id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>The only part to which the forceps are intended to be applied is the
head, to the dimensions and form of which they are specially adapted.
Some practitioners have used them on the breech, but the practice is
not generally sanctioned, because they seldom retain their hold on this
part and are nearly sure to seriously injure the child when so applied.
With properly constructed forceps, rightly applied to the head, there
is but little danger either to the mother or the child; but in the
hands of an unskillful or careless person the consequences of their use
may be deplorable to both.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to remark that the forceps are neither
<em>cutting</em> nor <em>crushing</em> instruments, but are simply
intended to <em>lay hold</em>, like the hand itself, and enable us to
draw down the head, or change its position. Most usually they are made
long and curved, as shown in the above plate, but sometimes they are
made much shorter and straight. They may be used upon the head when
it is either at the upper or the lower straits, or while it is in the
passage; but on no account should they be applied till the parts are
fully dilated, and everything indicates that the child <em>can</em>
pass. Thus they should never be used when the head is too large, or the
pelvis too small, nor when there are tumors in the way. In short no
attempt should be made with them to <em>force</em> the fœtus through
a passage which will not admit it by reasonable efforts. M. Dubois
says they should never be used when the pelvic diameter is less than
<em>three inches</em>, because with such dimensions the child is nearly
certain to be crushed to death, and the mother can scarcely escape
serious bruises and lacerations. In like manner, if they are thrust
into the womb before the mouth of it is naturally dilated they are sure
to tear and injure it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348"
id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary here to give directions for using the forceps in
every variety of presentation and position, but simply to show the mode
of applying them as they are most frequently required. The two blades
are adjusted separately, one to each side of the head, and then locked
together, so that the head is firmly inclosed between them, but not
crushed. Dr. Denman gives perhaps the best and simplest directions on
this point, and I therefore quote from his work.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The first part of the operation consists in passing the forefinger
of the right hand behind the ossa pubis and the head of the child to
the ear; then taking the part of the forceps to be first introduced
by the handle in the left hand, the point of the blade is to be
slowly conducted between the head of the child and the finger till
the instrument touches the ear: there can be no difficulty or hazard
in carrying the instrument thus far, because it will be guided, and
in some measure shielded, by the finger. But the further introduction
must be made with a slow semi-rotatory motion, keeping the point of
the blade not rigidly, yet closely, to the head of the child, by
raising the handle toward the pubes. In this manner the blade must
be carried gently along the head till the lock reaches the external
parts near the anterior angle of the pudendum. The point of the blade,
while introducing, sometimes hitches upon the ear of the child, and
it then requires a little elevation. But when it has passed the ear,
and is beyond the guidance of the finger, should there be any check
to the introduction either of this or the other blade, it should be
withdrawn a little, to give us an opportunity of discovering the cause
of the obstacle, which we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349"
id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> never strive to overcome by violence,
though we must proceed with firmness. When the first blade is properly
introduced, it must be held steadily in its place by pressing the
handle towards the pubes, and it will be a guide in the introduction
and application of the second blade. Let the second blade be introduced
in this manner. Keep the blade first introduced in its place with
the two lesser fingers of the left hand, and carry the fore-finger
of the same hand between the perineum and head of the child as high
as you can reach. Then take the second blade of the forceps by the
handle in the right hand, and, conveying the point between the finger
placed within the perineum and the head of the child, conduct the
instrument, with the precautions before mentioned, so far that the
lock shall touch the interior part of the perineum, or even press it
a little backwards. In order to fix the two blades thus introduced,
that which was placed towards the pubes must be slowly withdrawn, and
carried so far backwards that it can be locked with the second blade
retained in its first position; and care must be taken that nothing
be entangled in the lock, by passing the finger round it. When the
forceps are locked, it will be convenient to tie the handles together
with sufficient firmness to prevent them from sliding or changing
their position when they are not held in the hand, but not in such
a manner as to increase the compression upon the head of the child.
Should the blades of the forceps be introduced so as not to be opposite
each other, they could not be locked; or if, when applied, the handles
should come close together, or be at a great distance from each other,
they would probably slip, or there would be a failure of some kind in
the operation, as the bulk of the head would not be included,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> or
they would be fixed on some improper part of the head; though allowance
is to be made for the difference in the size of the heads of children.
But if a case be proper for the forceps, if they be well applied,
and we were to act slowly with them, there would not be much risk of
failure or disappointment. The difficulty of applying the forceps is
most frequently occasioned by attempting to apply them too soon, or by
passing them in a wrong direction, or by entangling the soft parts of
the mother between the instrument and the head of the child, against
all which accidents we are to be on our guard.</p>

<p>"When the forceps are first locked, they are placed backwards,
with the lock close to, or just within, the internal surface of the
perineum; and they can have no support backwards, except the little
which is afforded by the soft parts. The first action with them should
therefore be made by bringing the handles, grasped firmly in one or
both hands, to prevent the instrument from playing upon the head of the
child, slowly towards the pubes till they come to a full rest. Having
waited a short interval with them in that situation, the handles must
be carried back in the same slow but steady manner to the perineum,
exerting, as they are carried in the different situations, a certain
degree of extracting force; and after waiting another interval, they
are again to be carried towards the pubes, according to the direction
of the handles. Throughout the operation, especially the first part,
the action of that blade of the forceps originally applied towards
the pubes must be stronger and more extensive than the action with
the other blade, this having no fulcrum to support it, and chiefly
answering the purpose of regulating the action of the other blade.
If there were any labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351"
id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> pains when the operation was begun, or
should they come on in the course of it, the forceps should only be
acted with during the continuance of the pains; the intention being,
not only to supply the want or insufficiency of the pains, but to
follow them, and imitate also the manner in which they return. By a
few repetitions of this alternate action and rest before described,
we shall soon be sensible of the descent of the head; and it will be
proper to examine very frequently, to know the progress made, that we
may not use more force than needful, nor go on with more haste than
may be expedient or safe. In every case we ought to proceed slowly and
circumspectly, not forgetting that a small degree of force, continued
for a long time, will in general be equivalent to a greater force
hastily exerted, and with infinitely less detriment to the mother or
child. But after some time, should we not perceive the head to descend,
the force hitherto used must be gradually increased, till it be
sufficient to overcome the obstacles to the delivery of the patient. It
was before observed, as the head of the child descended, that the face
would be accordingly turned towards the hollow of the sacrum, without
any aim or assistance on our part. Of course the position of the
handles of the forceps, and the direction in which we ought to act with
them, should alter; for they becoming first more diagonal or oblique
with respect to the pelvis, and then more and more lateral, every
change in their position will require a differently directed action,
because the handles should ever be antagonists to each other. In
proportion also to the descent of the head the handles of the forceps
should approach nearer to the pubes; so that, in the beginning of the
operation, though we acted in the direction of the cavity of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
pelvis, towards the conclusion we should act in that of the vagina.
When we feel that we have the command of the head, by its being cleared
of the pelvis, and the external parts begin to be distended, we ought
to act yet more slowly, especially in the case of a first child, or
there would be great danger of a laceration of the soft parts; and this
can only be prevented by acting very deliberately in the direction of
the vagina&mdash;by giving the parts time to distend&mdash;by duly
supporting the perineum, which is the part chiefly in danger, with the
palm of the hand&mdash;by soothing and moderating the hurry and efforts
of the patient&mdash;and, in some cases, by absolutely resisting for a
certain time the passage of the head through the external parts."</p>

    <p class="hangingindent2">The manner in which the forceps draw the
head is well shown in the above plate, and also the compression of the
head itself, which is seen to be squeezed almost to a point at its
presenting part. This compression, however, is not likely to do serious
injury, unless it be excessive. The child may be convulsed a little
from it, but usually recovers, and suffers nothing afterwards.</p>
  </div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354"
id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>It is merely necessary to remark, in conclusion, that the forceps
should never be used till it is manifestly impossible for the child to
be born without them; and it should be remembered that nature alone
frequently effects delivery under the most unfavorable circumstances,
by giving her time. We should wait therefore as long as the safety of
the mother will allow, but never delay a moment when that safety is
compromised.</p>

<p>The accidents which have followed from the use of the forceps are
numerous and terrible, and I could give a most horrifying account of
them if it were necessary. It must be recollected however, that these
accidents have chiefly followed from want of skill in managing the
instrument, or from its being used under improper circumstances. It is
true that there is always more or less of pain and injury to be dreaded
from the forceps, even in the most favorable cases, and with the most
competent operators, but this is no argument against their employment
altogether. In every case where they are really called for, the female
would, most probably, die undelivered, or have to be cut open, so that
it is simply a choice of evils, of which the forceps are the least.</p>

<p>The cases in which the forceps are absolutely necessary however, are
<span class="smcap">VERY RARE</span>, much more so in fact than many
people suppose. <em>Patience</em>, and the persevering use of ordinary
assistance, would probably succeed alone in half the cases where they
are now employed.</p>

<p>In Murphy's lectures on <em>difficult Labors</em>, he gives
us some valuable statistics on this subject. He tells us that in
<em>seventy-five thousand nine hundred and eleven labors</em>, the
forceps were used only <em>one hundred and thirty-eight times</em>, or
once in every <em>five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355"
id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> and fifty</em> labors. In these one
hundred and thirty-eight cases <em>thirty-five</em> of the children
died, and <em>ten</em> of the mothers. Dr. Murphy however, thinks
that the general results, to both mother and child, would be equally
favorable if the forceps were <em>not used at all</em>, and he gives
the tables of Dr. Collins to support his opinions. From these tables it
really appears that, when all the difficult labors were left entirely
to nature, the number of deaths was <em>just about the same as when
the forceps are used</em>, in fact <em>rather less</em>, while the
accidents, and subsequent evils, were not nearly so great. Dr. M.
therefore thinks that the forceps should <em>never</em> be used, except
in a few cases where everything is quite favorable to the passage of
the fœtus; and the uterus <em>cannot</em> be made, in a reasonable
time, to contract and expel it; and also when <em>immediate</em>
delivery is needed to save the mother's life, as in flooding. In cases
of mere ordinary difficulty or delay, he decries their use entirely;
and he evidently thinks that when the labor is <em>fit</em> to be
terminated by the forceps, nature can and will terminate it herself
if left alone. There is no doubt but that they are now used a great
deal <em>too much</em>, either from a desire to <em>operate</em>, or
from <em>want of patience</em>; and I have no hesitation in expressing
my opinion that more have been <em>killed</em> than <em>saved</em> by
them.</p>


<h5>OTHER INSTRUMENTS.</h5>

<p>Respecting other instruments, such as the <em>Crotchet</em>, the
<em>Vectis</em>, and the <em>Cephalotribe</em>, or <em>crushing
forceps</em>, it is not necessary to say anything here, as their
use, when imperatively needed, must necessarily be confined to the
surgeon; and fortunately may now be dispensed with altogether.
The recently introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356"
id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> practice of bringing on <em>premature
labor</em>, in all cases of deformity or smallness of the pelvis,
entirely obviates the necessity for any of these dreadful resorts,
if the difficulty be known in time, which it is sure to be when a
sufficient degree of knowledge is disseminated.</p>

<p>The <em>Cesarian operation</em>, or cutting open the womb
externally; and <em>Cephalotomy</em>, or the opening of the child's
head, may also be dismissed with the same observations. <em>They can
always be avoided</em>, if the real condition of the patient is known
in time; and if from neglect nothing else can be done, they must always
be performed by a skillful surgeon.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXV.</h4>

<h5>OPERATIONS WITH THE HAND.</h5>


<h5>TURNING.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the most useful operations
that the accoucheur can perform, in many cases, and has the advantage
of being altogether accomplished <em>by the hand</em>. Its object
is to change the presentation, when unfavorable, and to facilitate
delivery. Most usually the hand is introduced into the uterus, and the
<em>feet</em> are brought down. This is called <em>pelvic version</em>;
but sometimes the head is brought to the mouth of the womb,
particularly in shoulder presentations, and this is called <em>cephalic
version</em>.</p>

<p><i>Cephalic Version.</i>&mdash;This can seldom be performed, and not
often attempted with safety. In some cases however, when it is
ascertained that the shoulder presents, and before the membranes are
broken, an effort may be made to remove it and bring the head in
its place. To do this the position of the head must be ascertained
externally, and one hand placed upon it; then with the two forefingers
of the other raise up the shoulder from within, as in ballotment,
and endeavor to push the head into its place. If the child be very
moveable this may sometimes be done, and will be highly advantageous;
but most frequently the substitution cannot be accomplished, and the
attempt ruptures the membranes, after which it is still more difficult,
and even becomes dangerous. Even if the head be brought down there
is always danger of its becoming displaced, and the shoulder<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> again
presented, owing to the tendency which any presentation has to be
reproduced. To prevent this the hand should be firmly pressed on the
fœtus, externally, as soon as the head is brought down, to fix it; and
the membranes should be ruptured so that it may begin to descend, after
which there is no danger of a change.</p>

<p>Cephalic version can be so seldom performed however, and is so
difficult, and sometimes dangerous, that it is seldom or never
attempted; more particularly as pelvic version can always be
substituted, and is more easy and safe. It is true that presentations
of the head are the most favorable, providing they occur before the
rupture of the membranes, but after that event they may not be so
favorable as those of the lower extremities, and certainly are not so
easy or safe to induce.</p>

<p><i>Pelvic Version.</i>&mdash;Turning to bring down the feet is performed
for various reasons, and under many different circumstances. As a
general principle we may say that it is done either to change the
presentation, when unfavorable, or to terminate the labor when it
is lingering, or when it is desirable to have it over as quickly as
possible. The feet may be drawn through the mouth of the Womb when it
is but little opened, and when they have once passed, the limbs and
body soon follow, and the head seldom remains long behind. The fœtus
may in fact be compared to a <em>wedge</em>, of which the feet are the
point, and if they enter the passage the rest part is gradually driven
after by the uterine contractions.</p>

<p>The chief contingencies which call for the operation of turning are,
a protracted labor, a presentation of the placenta, causing hemorrhage,
and a wrong presentation, particularly one of the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359"
id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The operation of turning is very clearly explained by Dr. Lee,
and I know from experience that his directions can be safely relied
upon. It very frequently happens however, that there will be some
peculiar circumstances in a case, which will necessitate more or
less change in the manner of proceeding, so that the practitioner
must after all be guided, to a great extent, by the requirements and
conditions then existing. Dr. Lee's directions therefore, must merely
be considered as <em>general</em> ones, to be modified as occasion may
require:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When the operation of turning is required before the membranes are
ruptured, and when the orifice of the uterus is widely dilated, and
there are long intervals between the pains, it is accompanied with
little difficulty and danger. Having explained to the patient and her
relatives the nature of the case, let her lie on the left side near
the edge of the bed, with the knees drawn up to the abdomen. Sit down
by the side of the bed, and quietly take off your coat; lay bare your
right arm by turning up the shirt above the elbow, and cover the back
of the hand and the whole forearm with cold cream, lard, or a solution
of soap. Introduce one finger after another into the vagina, and slowly
and effectually dilate its orifice. The hand, in a conical form, and in
a state of half supination, must then be pressed steadily forward with
a semi-rotatory motion against the perineum and sides of the passage,
till it clears the orifice of the vagina. This should always be done
very slowly and gently, as it is accompanied with great pain. Let the
hand remain some time in the orifice of the vagina, that it may be
fully dilated, and offer no resistance in the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> subsequent steps
of the operation of turning. When the hand has dilated the vagina
sufficiently, in the absence of pain gently insinuate the points of
the fingers and thumb into the os uteri in a conical form; and if it
is not sufficiently open to allow the hand to pass, you must proceed
next to use artificial dilatation here also, very gently and slowly,
always stopping as soon as a pain comes on, but not withdrawing the
fingers altogether at the time from the os uteri. Having succeeded in
dilating the part without rupturing the membranes, slide the hand up
between the membranes and the anterior part of the uterus into the
cavity, and grasp the feet when the membranes give way. Most frequently
the membranes burst as the hand is entering the uterus, before it
reaches the feet, and the liquor amnii rushes out and is lost, if it
is not prevented by pressing the hand forward firmly into the orifice.
Never be contented with one foot when it is possible to grasp both; and
this can always be done when the liquor amnii has not escaped, and the
uterus is not closely contracted round the body of the child. Seize
both feet and legs, and when there is no pain, draw them down into the
vagina; and as the nates descend through the os uteri, the shoulder and
arm will gradually recede or be retracted, and will offer no obstacle
to the remaining part of the operation, which should be completed
as if the nates and inferior extremities had originally presented,
and which has already been very fully described. In actual practice,
except in twin cases, the membranes have been ruptured and the liquor
amnii is gone, in a great proportion of cases&mdash;in about ten to
one&mdash;long before we are called upon to deliver by turning, and the
operation is then a much more serious affair. Sometimes, when the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span> os
uteri is half dilated, there is an interval of freedom from pain for
several hours after the rupture of the membranes, and partial escape of
the liquor amnii. Here it is advisable to turn without delay; and the
hand can be passed up into the uterus and the feet brought down with
little more difficulty than if the membranes had not been ruptured."</p>

</div>

<p>The operation of turning is however beset with many difficulties,
and unless the conditions for it are very favorable, and the operator
skillful, it may cause greater mischief than it is intended to remedy.
The probability is, as in the case of other operations, that it would
seldom or never be needed if proper means were used in time, and
perseveringly; and it is yet a question whether the prospect, for both
mother and child, would not be more favorable if the delivery was
always left to nature, in those cases where version is now attempted.
Dr. Collins says, "As to turning, the risk to the mother is, in the
majority of cases, so great as to forbid its employment, nor do I think
the practitioner justified by the circumstances in so greatly hazarding
his patient's life."</p>

<h2>PART II.</h2>

<p class="center">THE DISEASES OF WOMEN DURING PREGNANCY, AND IN
CHILD-BED.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Women</span> are liable during pregnancy, and
after childbirth, to most of the diseases which afflict them at other
times, and also to many derangements peculiar to those periods. As a
general rule either of those conditions somewhat modifies the disease,
and also necessitates certain differences in its treatment. My former
work on the <cite>Diseases of Women</cite> having treated on all those
affections common to every other period, I shall in this confine myself
chiefly to those peculiar to the two conditions referred to; giving
their causes, symptoms, and treatment, with practical hints for their
prevention.</p>

<h3>SECTION IX.</h3>

<p class="center">THE DISEASES OF PREGNANCY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> diseases which are found during
pregnancy are of two kinds; the first kind called <em>Sympathetic</em>,
or nervous, consist of various derangements of different parts of the
system, produced chiefly by nervous sympathy with the Womb. The second
kind, called <em>Idiopathic</em>, are real primary derangements of the
Generative Organs themselves, or of those intimately connected with
them. Each of these kinds will be treated of separately.</p>

</div>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366"
id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>



<h4>CHAPTER XXVI.</h4>

<h5>SYMPATHETIC DISEASES OCCURRING DURING PREGNANCY.</h5>


<h5>SICKNESS AND VOMITING.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Nausea</span>, or sickness, with or without
vomiting, is one of the most frequent and troublesome accompaniments of
pregnancy. It is so general, in fact, as to be looked upon as one of
the earliest and most reliable signs of that state. It is undoubtedly
caused, in the earlier stages, simply by the intimate sympathy which
exists between the stomach and womb, and which causes one of those
organs to be temporarily deranged whenever the other is in any unusual
condition. In the latter months it is also produced by the enlarged
womb pressing on the lower part of the stomach, as it rises in the
abdomen. In many diseases of the womb, particularly in enlargements,
and tumors, the stomach will become deranged in precisely the same
manner as during pregnancy, and the patient is frequently deceived
thereby as to her real condition.</p>

<p>In most cases the sickness does not begin till about the second
month, and it seldom lasts beyond the third or fourth. There are some
however, with whom it commences almost immediately after fecundation,
and others with whom it lasts till the very commencement of labor. I
have even known persons who always experienced the nausea <em>at the
very moment of conception</em>, and who were thus aware when <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>that
event took place. With some persons the trouble occurs only during
certain parts of the day, most usually in the morning, while with
others it comes on irregularly, or even endures constantly. In
most cases it is not very severe, and causes but little distress;
occasionally however, it is very serious, and may even lead to fatal
results, in spite of all that can be done. Abortion is frequently
brought on by it; and so are faintings, and spitting of blood. Many
women however, will vomit with violence, during almost the whole
period, without either accident or evil effect. The treatment must
vary according to the cause of the derangement, its violence, and the
effect it produces. In regard to diet but little can be said that
will be found generally applicable. Mild and light food is generally
recommended, but is not always the best, for some females can only
keep on their stomachs the most indigestible articles. Perhaps nothing
more can be said, with propriety, than that the patient should take
<em>whatever she can retain</em>, particularly if she has become weak
from want of nourishment, which is often the case. Some females can
only keep down a little broth, or tea, or sweetened water, while others
find solid food the best, or fruits. I have known many able to take
<em>Gum Arabic</em>, either solid or dissolved in water, and retain it,
when nothing else could be borne. This is nourishing, and may often
keep up the strength till the sickness abates.</p>

<p>There are many remedies that will sometimes relieve, though
frequently they are of no use whatever. A little wine or brandy, or
orange flower water;&mdash;a few drops of laudanum, or ether, or
essence of peppermint, may be tried. One or two ipecac, or cayenne,
or camphor lozenges, will sometimes be efficacious, and so will a
little Port wine and Peruvian bark, or<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> a seidlitz powder, or
even common soda water. A tea-spoonful of powdered charcoal succeeds
occasionally, or some very strong bitters, or a cordial, such as a
wine-glassful of curacoa. A plaster of opium may also be placed over
the stomach, or one of meal wet with laudanum. A mustard poultice
over the stomach, will frequently relieve when everything else
fails;&mdash;sometimes it is more effective however, when placed on
the spine, opposite the stomach. As a general rule the bowels should
be kept free, either with injections or with mild purgatives, as
castor oil, or manna. <em>Regular bathing</em> will often act as a
complete preventive or cure, and the vomiting may be frequently stopped
by simply dashing cold water over the stomach. Some practitioners
recommend <em>emetics</em>, and bleeding if the patient be of a full
plethoric habit. Leeches and cups have also been used over the stomach,
and sometimes with good effect. Ether and chloroform have also been
inhaled, and have operated favorably in a few instances. Plentiful
draughts of cold water, or swallowing bits of ice will likewise afford
relief to some.</p>

<p>In several instances the vomiting has been so violent, and the
patient has suffered so much, and become so exhausted from want of
nourishment, that it has been absolutely necessary, after all other
means have failed, to cause miscarriage, as the only means of saving
the patient's life.</p>

<p>Whenever the trouble <em>can</em> be borne, <em>Patience</em> is the
grand specific. The sufferer must recollect that it will surely cease
with delivery, and most probably before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369"
id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>


<h5>PTYALISM, OR EXCESSIVE SALIVATION.</h5>

<p>Some pregnant females will secrete an immense amount of saliva for
weeks and months in succession, as if they had been salivated. I have
never known a case in which this discharge caused any evil, even when
very great, though it is often troublesome. It would probably not be
judicious to stop it, even if we could do so, as long as it does no
harm, though it may be advisable at times to moderate it. The only
treatment proper to effect this is, to keep the bowels free and the
body well bathed, and to gargle the mouth with mint or balm teas, or
canella water, or a little syrup of poppies.</p>

<p>This discharge, like the vomiting, arises from the sympathetic
action of the uterus, and it generally ceases about the fourth month,
though with some it will last the whole time.</p>


<h5>ODONTALGIA, OR TOOTHACHE.</h5>

<p>This is also a very general trouble during pregnancy, and sometimes
a very severe one. Like several other sympathetic affections it is very
irregular as to its first appearance and duration, some suffering from
it most of the time, almost without intermission, while others only
have it at intervals, and but slightly.</p>

<p>It sometimes depends upon unsound teeth, but is frequently
experienced without any such cause, and is then a true
<em>neuralgia</em>. When it arises from a bad tooth, the pain is
usually confined more or less to the neighborhood of the tooth,
but when it is neuralgic it extends over the greater part or the
whole of the jaw and face, and darts about from one part to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
another. In true toothache there is also usually more or less
inflammation and swelling, while in the most agonizing neuralgia
nothing of the kind can be seen.</p>

<p>The treatment must be regulated by circumstances. If the pain
appears to be kept up by an unsound tooth, it should by all means be
extracted, unless the patient be so exceedingly nervous and irritable
that abortion is to be feared, in which case the pain must be
alleviated as well as it can be, though there is almost as much danger
in leaving the tooth in such cases as in extracting it. A few leeches
to the gums will sometimes relieve, or a mustard poultice to the cheek,
or a blister behind the ear. The stomach or bowels being out of order
may also keep up the irritation, and regulating them may materially
assist in giving relief. Some persons are relieved by lotions of
camphor, or laudanum, and others by washes of cayenne tea, or alum
water. In the neuralgic form, when no particular tooth can be found in
fault, the treatment must be more general than local. The <em>Carbonate
of Iron Pills</em>, which can be purchased at the druggists ready made,
have frequently an excellent effect; from two to four may be taken at
a dose, twice a day, the bowels being kept open, if necessary, by a
little tincture of rhubarb. If the pain comes at regular intervals,
or intermits, it may frequently be stopped by quinine. <em>Two</em>
of the ordinary <em>quinine pills</em> may be taken every <em>five
hours</em>, for two or three days. If the head feels oppressed by
their use, the dose must be lessened to <em>one</em>. M. Guillemeau
recommends the following to be tried if other means fail, and I
have known it to be of decided benefit. Take the whites of <em>two
eggs</em>, and <em>two ounces of common black pepper</em>, in powder,
and beat them well together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371"
id="Page_371">[371]</a></span> Spread this on some tow or cotton, and
lay it on the cheek. It may be kept on till it causes considerable
irritation, and sometimes may be used on both sides.</p>

<p>Some females have been relieved by bathing the face in <em>cold</em>
water, or keeping <em>ice</em> in the mouth, and others by hot
fomentations. It has also been recommended to fill the mouth with cold
water, and bathe the cheek with hot at the same time!</p>

<p>Occasionally an abscess, or gum boil will form, and when there seems
a tendency to that it may be promoted by keeping a roasted fig in
between the cheek and gum, over the part where the abscess points; when
full, it should be lanced, as the discharge usually gives relief.</p>

<p>This pain is however very obstinate sometimes, and defies all
treatment, but is seldom of such long duration when so severe.</p>


<h5>DERANGEMENTS OF THE APPETITE.</h5>

<p>The powerful sympathetic action of the womb on the stomach produces
not only nausea and vomiting, but various derangements of the
appetite and taste also. All of these require notice, and some need
attention.</p>

<p><i>Anorexia.</i>&mdash;This means a complete distaste, or even disgust,
for food, sometimes of particular articles only, and sometimes for
those of every kind. It seldom lasts beyond the fourth month, but
occasionally during the whole period. It is remarkable how some females
will be affected in this way, and how little they will eat, for several
months together. This however is scarcely ever of any consequence,
for the system does not seem to suffer in the slightest<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
degree; on the contrary, the mother will remain quite stout, and the
child be born fully developed, though the quantity of food taken has
apparently been scarcely sufficient to sustain life.</p>

<p>In many cases there is even a decided benefit from this state of
things, particularly in those who are of a too full habit.</p>

<p>As long as the loss of appetite is merely of a sympathetic or
nervous character it is not necessary nor advisable to resort to any
special treatment. But when it arises from indigestion, or a foul
stomach, it is necessary to attend to it. A mild emetic of ipecac or
warm mustard and water, may be given, or a dose of Epsom Salts. This
state will be recognized by a furred tongue, unpleasant breath, and
uneasiness at the pit of the stomach; while in the purely nervous
anorexia nothing of the kind is observed. Sometimes it may arise
merely from debility of the stomach, and in that case a few of the
<em>Carbonate of Iron Pills</em> will be of use. In general the patient
is benefited rather than injured by this voluntary fasting.</p>

<p><i>Boulimia.</i>&mdash;This state is the reverse of the former, meaning
a ravenous appetite. Some females exhibit it in a most extraordinary
degree, and will eat to excess of anything that comes in their way.
Many injure themselves in this manner, by causing indigestion,
flatulence, heartburn, vomiting, and even inflammation of the stomach.
It is of no use reasoning with them, for the appetite is so strong that
they will eat let them suffer ever so much.</p>

<p>All that can be done in such cases is, to drink freely of various
nourishing liquids, such as soup, broth, rice milk, or chocolate;
and by eating jelly, arrow-root, and eggs. These contain much
nourishment in a small space, and satisfy the hunger without<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
overloading the stomach. The appetite may also be deadened considerably
by eating figs, dates, sugar, or chocolate; and by drinking soda
water.</p>

<p><i>Capricious Appetite.</i>&mdash;Sometimes a female is found to have an
inordinate desire for some one particular article of diet, which she
will eat to excess, but will not touch anything else; this is called
<em>malacia</em>. Others will have a craving for some article not
proper for food;&mdash;this is called <em>Pica</em>. They will devour
chalk, cinders, earth, wood, flies, spiders, charcoal, and various
other things, sometimes of the most disgusting kind, though ordinarily
they may be quite fastidious in their diet. This unnatural desire is
also frequently seen in hysteria and chlorosis, and in several uterine
diseases.</p>

<p>It does not appear that a moderate indulgence of these unusual
tastes is at all injurious, unless the article wished for be of
a decidedly hurtful character. On the contrary, it is reasonably
conjectured, by many physiologists, that they arise from a real want
in the system of the very substances longed for. For instance, there
may not be in the mother's blood sufficient <em>lime</em> to form the
bones of the child, and this deficiency is intimated by her desire
for chalk or plaster; nature having no other mode of making her wants
known, or of causing them to be supplied. As a general rule, so long
as the indulgence is not obviously improper, it should be allowed to a
reasonable extent, both to gratify the patient and to answer to what
are probably the demands of nature.</p>

<p>It is seldom that interference is needed in these cases, except when
there is danger of the patient doing herself harm; we may then try to
alter the condition of the stomach, and so change the taste.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> A
gentle emetic will sometimes do this, or a saline purgative. If these
fail use a few of the <em>Carbonate of Iron Pills</em>, or some good
strong bitters, or teas, drunk freely, such as Cammomile, Boneset or
Centaury.</p>


<h5>PYROSIS.</h5>

<p>This disease is more frequently called <em>water brash</em> and
sometimes <em>heart burn</em>. It is characterized by the raising of a
hot acrid fluid into the throat, causing a sensation of burning from
the stomach upward, even to the mouth. It is a very frequent attendant
upon many forms of dyspepsia, and is generally experienced more or
less by most pregnant females, arising either from improper diet or
from mere sympathetic derangement. If it arises only from errors of
diet, a reform in that particular is all that is needed, but if it is
merely sympathetic nothing can be done beyond palliating it, to give
temporary relief. For this purpose the patient must take a spoonful
of lime water, in half a tumbler of milk two or three times a day, or
some carbonate of soda, or magnesia, with a few drops of laudanum if
there be any pain. In those cases which resist such remedies a little
of the <em>compound iron mixture</em> may be of service, such as can be
obtained at the druggists. A nourishing diet should also be observed,
and plenty of exercise should be taken in the open air.</p>


<h5>DYSPHAGIA.</h5>

<p>Difficulty of swallowing, which is meant by this term, is a
more troublesome and alarming affection, frequently attendant
on pregnancy. There is however nothing dangerous in it, except
that it frightens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375"
id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> the patient. Some will gasp and be
unable to swallow, or even speak, for a considerable time, and will
think they have something in the throat. It is however entirely
a nervous symptom, arising from uterine irritation, and seldom
lasts beyond the third or fourth month. A little cordial, wine,
or brandy, will frequently relieve it, or some spirits of camphor
rubbed on the neck. M. Colombat d'l'Isere recommends the following
ointment, to be rubbed on the neck. Extract of Belladonna forty-seven
grains,&mdash;Extract of Strammonium fifteen grains,&mdash;white wax
one ounce,&mdash;oil of lemons twelve drops.&mdash;These must be warmed
and well rubbed together. A dash of cold water on the throat and chest
will often succeed better than anything else.</p>


<h5>GASTRALGIA.</h5>

<p>This is commonly termed cramp at the stomach, or nervous colic.
It consists of a severe kind of cramp, with dragging and cutting
sensations in the stomach, as if it were being tied in knots and cut to
pieces. Sometimes the attack will only last for a few minutes, and then
totally pass away, at other times it will remain for half an hour or
more, and cause the most intense suffering. The patient will be drawn
together, or doubled up, with her hands placed on her stomach, and will
groan and exhibit in her features the greatest agony; sometimes even,
she will faint away with it.</p>

<p>This affection may, like the others, be merely nervous, and
then it is attended by nothing but the pain. It may also arise
from real inflammation of the stomach, and then it is attended by
fever, excessive soreness and tenderness of the stomach when<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
touched, and by a hot, dry mouth. In the nervous spasm the pain is
frequently relieved by pressure, but when inflammation exists the
pressure increases it.</p>

<p>Some females always have these attacks whenever the stomach is
empty, and they pass away immediately anything is taken to eat or
drink. With others they are often brought on by overloading the
stomach, or by eating some improper articles.</p>

<p>To relieve the spasm, one of the best things is a <em>tea-spoonful
of Compound Spirits of Lavender</em>, taken without water. This nearly
always gives relief in ten minutes at most; but if necessary a second
spoonful may be taken in a quarter of an hour. A little brandy, or
peppermint, or curacoa cordial will also succeed in many instances,
or simply drinking freely of any hot tea, or swallowing half a
tea-spoonful of common pepper. A mustard plaster put on hot over the
stomach will scarcely ever fail, even without anything being taken
internally. M. Colombat gives the following recipe as one which he
has found efficacious, and it is certainly a pleasant one. Orange and
Linden Flower waters each two ounces; Syrup of Ether and of Valerian
each one ounce; Syrup of Poppy heads half an ounce. Of this mixture
a tea-spoonful may be given every quarter of an hour till the pain
abates.</p>

<p>To prevent the return of the attack, the patient must carefully
avoid everything that disagrees with the stomach, or creates wind; she
must keep the bowels free, and accustom herself to regular bathing or
rubbing the body. If the stomach appear weak, which is often the case,
some Boneset tea, or Port wine and bark, or a few of the Carbonate of
Iron Pills may be advantageous. If there be acid on the stomach, use
the means recommended for heartburn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377"
id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>


<h5>CONSTIPATION.</h5>

<p>This is a very common trouble with pregnant females, and one that
may lead to many others. Very frequently it arises merely from the
pressure of the expanded uterus upon the large intestine, but it may
also arise from a simple want of power, the uterine action having
apparently weakened the force of all the neighboring organs. It is
advisable to correct it as soon as possible, let it arise how it may,
as it is very apt to cause various derangements of the stomach and
intestines, and even inflammation of the womb itself. As a general
rule, not more than three days should elapse without the bowels being
moved, though some will remain a week or more without any apparent
inconvenience; but there is always danger in such delay.</p>

<p>Many females do themselves much harm by taking what they call
opening medicines, the action of which is often more injurious than the
constipation itself. All drastic purgatives, such as aloes, gamboge,
colocynth, and jalap should be carefully avoided, as they not only
make the costiveness worse after their action is over, but they also
frequently produce inflammation, and even abortion, by the violent
straining they cause. The best medicines, when they are really needed,
are manna, seidlitz powders, or castor oil. Enemas are better however,
as a general rule, such as those of thin starch, or molasses and water,
to which may be added a little castor oil. The grand aim should be, in
all such cases, to stimulate the bowels to an increased action without
medicines, by a properly regulated diet! Salads may be eaten when they
do not cause derangement of the stomach, and ripe or stewed fruits,
particularly figs, dates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378"
id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> prunes. Soups are also good, except they
contain rice, or vermicelli, or maccaroni. Bran bread should be eaten
regularly, and not white. The only meats should be veal or poultry.
As a drink lemonade is excellent, with a little cream of tartar, or
tamarind tea, or barley water sweetened with honey. With some patients
a cup of coffee, or a glass of beer will always relieve the bowels,
especially if a glass of water is also drank after it. I have known
persons neglect the bowels so long that they have become completely
impacted, by the hard fæces, and could be relieved only by instruments.
It is very important to attend to this affection in time, and to
persevere with the means of permanent relief regularly.</p>


<h5>DYSENTERY AND DIARRHŒA.</h5>

<p>It is frequently the case that pregnant females, instead of being
constipated are afflicted with severe diarrhœa. This may arise from
inflammation, and is then attended by fever, and extreme tenderness and
soreness of the bowels. Most usually however it is entirely nervous,
and arises from the sympathetic irritation of the womb. There is then
no tenderness or soreness, no fever, no derangements of the appetite,
nor in fact any other symptom of any consequence. If it remains long
unchecked blood will be discharged, from the extreme irritation of the
intestines, and it is then called dysentery. This is nearly always
accompanied by fever and general irritation. Sometimes there will be a
constant and painful desire felt to move the bowels, but with little
power to do so, and at the same time a burning heat and unpleasant
sensation at the fundus. This is called <em>tenesmus</em>, and the
straining from it has frequently produced abortion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379"
id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>If the diarrhœa is not excessive, and the female does not lose her
appetite, or strength, it is better let alone, particularly if she be
of a full habit, and disposed to fever. If thought desirable to check
it a little, this may usually be done by a change in the diet. Rice
milk, sago, tapioca, and arrow-root may be taken, white bread may be
used, and not much fluid drunk. If such means are insufficient an
injection may be thrown up the rectum in the morning, of thin starch,
with a tea-spoonful of laudanum. The abdomen may also be well fomented,
and a dose of Tincture of Rhubarb taken occasionally. If the tenesmus
is very troublesome, an injection of tepid water may be used, and
the female should sit occasionally over the steam of hot water: in
extremely painful cases a few leeches may be used round the fundament,
and a hot flaxseed poultice placed over the abdomen. A warm bath is
also an excellent remedy with many. When the diarrhœa still continues
notwithstanding the above remedies, resort should be had to tonics
and opiates. The patient should take Port wine and Peruvian bark, or
some <em>Gentian wine</em>, and use injections of Starch and Laudanum
regularly. Cammomile tea may also be freely drunk, and an opium pill
may be taken at night. Above all, the patient must endeavor to avoid
all mental agitation. When dysentery sets in, every effort should be
made to subdue it as early as possible. Half a pint of rice milk, with
ten or fifteen drops of laudanum may be taken two or three times a
day, and an injection may also be used night and morning of flaxseed,
with fifteen or twenty drops of laudanum. M. Colombat recommends the
following recipe as seldom failing to cure. Take the whites of six
eggs and beat them up in a quart of water;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> then use one-third as a
drink, and the rest as an injection. A neat spoonful should be drunk
every ten minutes, and an injection used every two hours, but not
more than one small syringeful at a time. A tea-spoonful of syrup of
poppies, with some loaf sugar, may also be added to every spoonful that
is drunk. Eggs, jellies, and rich soups, with meat and wine, if there
be no inflammation, may be taken regularly, in addition to the articles
already mentioned.</p>


<h5>DYSPNŒA, OR DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING.</h5>

<p>There are but few pregnant females who do not complain more or
less of difficulty of breathing, and this difficulty may arise from
different causes. In the earlier months it is caused by sympathetic
irritation only, the same as difficulty of swallowing. In the latter
months it is caused by the enlarged womb filling up the abdomen so much
that the lungs in the chest are pressed upon and have not sufficient
room to play freely. It may also be caused by a plethoric or too full
habit, the lungs then being in reality congested.</p>

<p>The temporary difficulty of breathing which is felt in the early
months, from nervous sympathy, needs scarcely any kind of treatment,
as it passes off naturally in a short time. In severe attacks the same
remedies may be used as for difficulty of swallowing before referred
to.</p>

<p>That which arises in the latter months, from pressure of the womb,
can frequently be relieved only by the patient remaining as long as
possible in certain favorable positions. I have known many who could
never sleep except when propped nearly upright, by means of pillows and
cushions, as immediately they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381"
id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> assumed the recumbent position the
upward pressure became so great they were nearly suffocated. In such
cases the patient should be careful never to eat or drink to excess,
nor take anything likely to produce wind, because the least increase in
the size of the abdomen adds to the difficulty. The bowels should also
be kept free, and nothing tight or heavy in the way of clothing should
be worn.</p>

<p>This difficulty is most frequently seen in those who have contracted
chests, and in those who have been accustomed to wear corsets and tight
dresses. A deformed pelvis may also give rise to it by forcing the womb
above its usual position. Many females both create and increase this
difficulty by binding themselves tighter than usual during pregnancy,
under the mistaken idea that it enables them to support their burden so
much easier.</p>

<p>When the dyspnœa arises from a full habit the patient must live
low, keep the body regularly bathed and rubbed, and the bowels freely
open by an occasional seidlitz powder, or dose of Epsom Salts. If
the difficulty becomes at any time suddenly great and alarming, the
feet should be placed immediately in hot water, while the patient is
upright; a mustard plaster should also be put upon the chest, and an
opening injection of starch and Castor Oil administered as soon as
possible. The usual practice in such cases is to bleed from the arm,
to the extent of eight or ten ounces, and in case no other means give
relief, this may be tried.</p>


<h5>COUGH.</h5>

<p>Like the previous affection cough is most usually produced during
pregnancy by sympathetic irritation.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span> It may arise, however
from a partial congestion, or inflammation of the lungs or bronchial
tubes, produced by a too great determination of blood to them. In the
merely nervous cough, there is no expectoration, nor any soreness or
pain in the chest, and it will frequently disappear for several days
together. No particular attention need be bestowed upon this cough,
unless it become so violent as to threaten abortion. In that case a
pill, containing one grain of opium, may be taken, or from ten to
fifteen drops of laudanum, whenever the attack is severe. Barley water,
or gum arabic water, may also be freely drunk, with a large spoonful
of Syrup of Poppies added to each pint. A small dose of Hive Syrup, or
Paregoric, will also be found sometimes better than anything else. An
enema of Starch and Laudanum, as formerly described, will also relieve,
in some cases, better than anything taken by the mouth. The body should
be kept warm, particularly the feet, and a mustard poultice may be
placed over the chest, if the straining at any time becomes too great.
Some patients experience relief from an assafœtida pill, or a little
musk, and others from a small dram of cordial, or wine.</p>

<p>If there be expectoration, with fever, and tenderness in the chest,
or sharp pains when a long breath is drawn, there is reason to fear
inflammation of the lungs, or bronchitis. In this case all the above
means, except the wine and stimulants, may also be used only more
freely, and the mustard poultice must be kept on till it makes a
blister. The patient must live low, her feet must be frequently bathed
in hot water, and her bowels regularly opened either with saline
purgatives or enemas. All that is requisite is to keep the inflammation
from extending till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383"
id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> after delivery, when it usually subsides
without any further trouble. As soon as the womb is emptied, its
pressure upon the abdominal aorta ceases, and the blood can then flow
freely to the lower extremities, and thus the lungs become relieved and
the inflammation goes down.</p>


<h5>PALPITATION OF THE HEART.</h5>

<p>This is also a frequent accompaniment of pregnancy, and one that is
likely to cause alarm sometimes, from its violence. Unless dependant
upon organic disease of the heart however, it is in general only
a nervous affection, and passes away with delivery. We may always
reasonably suppose it to be nervous when it occurs only during
pregnancy, and particularly if it is irregular in its frequency and
violence. I have known females who were always attacked with it about
the same period, and who could therefore always tell when it was coming
on, and sometimes even how long it would last. It will sometimes come
on during sleep, and so forcibly as to waken the patient instantly. At
other times while awake, it will commence so suddenly that she will
sink down as if struck by a powerful blow.</p>

<p>The only directions that can be given for alleviating it are, to
keep as quiet as possible, use the bath regularly, avoid constipation,
and live rather low, particularly if the patient be of a full habit.
Exercise should also be taken regularly in the open air, but not of a
violent kind. She should also sleep with the head on a high pillow,
and never eat late suppers, nor take any food that disagrees with the
stomach.</p>

<p>All kinds of stimulants, such as wine, coffee and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
spices, should be abstained from, and all powerful emotions carefully
guarded against. During an attack a few drops of Laudanum, or an Opium
pill may be taken, and the feet placed in hot water. An Assafœtida pill
is sometimes good, or a little Ether. Bleeding is generally practised
in extreme cases, but there is often considerable danger in it.</p>

<p>A too full habit is often the exciting cause of the palpitation,
as may be seen by the patient being always liable on the slightest
exertion to flushed face, dimness of sight, ringing in the ears,
swelling of the limbs, and puffiness of the gums, sometimes to such
an extent that the mouth will taste of blood. Such persons should
carefully observe a moderate unstimulating and simple diet, and
never allow the bowels to remain constipated more than a single day.
They should also rub and wash the skin well, and study calmness and
quiet.</p>


<h5>SYNCOPE, OR FAINTING.</h5>

<p>In this condition, which is just the reverse of the former, the
heart suspends its action altogether; the breathing ceases, all power
of motion and feeling is lost, the face turns ghastly pale, the eyes
close, and the individual seems as if actually dead. It seldom lasts
however more than five minutes, when the pulse gradually begins to
beat, the color returns, and the individual slowly recovers. Some
females are liable to such attacks once a month, others once a week,
others every few days, and some at irregular periods. They are
generally preceded by a dull pain at the pit of the stomach, fullness
in the head, yawning, and loss of sight, or ringing in the ears.</p>

<p>The causes that predispose to this fainting are not<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span> very
well understood, though there is no doubt but it is mainly dependant
upon uterine disturbances. In some females it is brought on by the
sudden motions of the fœtus, or by their remaining too long in one
posture. In others it is produced by straining from constipation, or
by sudden fright or anger. In very nervous persons it not unfrequently
arises from unpleasant sights, smells, and sounds. In fact it is caused
in them much the same as a common hysterical fit, such as is described
in my <cite>Diseases of Woman</cite>. A full habit, and over feeding,
or drinking stimulating liquors may also bring it on, and so on the
contrary may a state of weakness and exhaustion.</p>

<p>This accident is more alarming than dangerous, except to the child,
which may lose its life if the fainting lasts too long.</p>

<p>To recover a person from one of these fainting fits, she should
be laid upon her back on a level place, and every part of her dress
should be carefully loosed. Some strong odor should then be applied to
the nostrils, such as hartshorn, vinegar, burnt feathers, or smelling
salts. The body should be well rubbed over the heart and lungs, either
with the hand or with a soft, dry napkin. Cold water may also be
dashed on the face, and the hands may be well chafed. If the fit still
endures, a mustard plaster may be placed on each arm, or the whole body
may be placed in a warm bath, if convenient. Care should also be taken
to admit the fresh air freely. As soon as she begins to show signs of
consciousness, a little wine or brandy may be placed in the mouth, and
the body may be elevated a little.</p>

<p>To guard against such attacks, the same precautions as to diet
and mode of life must be observed as were directed in the article
on palpitation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386"
id="Page_386">[386]</a></span> heart; and, as this accident is most
frequent in those of a hysterical habit, they should carefully follow
the advice given in the article <em>Hysteria</em>, in my <cite>Diseases
of Woman</cite>.</p>


<h5>HEADACHE AND DIZZINESS IN THE HEAD.</h5>

<p>Each of these distressing affections, both of which are very common
during pregnancy, may arise either from nervous excitement or from a
full habit and determination of blood to the head. Nervous headache
is generally met with in the earlier months of pregnancy, and is
characterized by being frequently periodical, and often confined to
particular spots. It also commences suddenly, from some excitement
or depression of mind, and leaves little or no distress when it is
gone. The headache, which arises from a too full habit, commences with
flushing of the face, heaviness in the eyes, dull pain in the forehead,
and a sense of uneasiness, with disposition to sleep or dose. It seldom
comes on much till the latter months of gestation. Headache may arise
also accidentally, from derangement of the stomach, but this cause is
easily ascertained by the furred tongue, loss of appetite, and bitter
taste in the mouth; it is also felt most acutely in the back of the
head, down by the neck, and passes away immediately the stomach is
corrected by an emetic, or by fasting.</p>

<p>Nervous headache during pregnancy often defies all our attempts
to alleviate it, though we sometimes succeed in doing so. The best
general remedies are warm baths, and, if the bowels are constipated,
enemas of starch and castor oil daily. To these may be added occasional
small doses of Laudanum, or an Opium pill, or two grains of Camphor.
Smelling odors, such as Camphor, Cologne, or Hartshorn, will<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
relieve some, but will make others worse; so that its utility can
only be determined by experience. When a severe attack comes on, the
patient should put her feet in warm water, or use a warm bath, take a
few drops of Laudanum, or a little Musk, or Valerian, and then try to
go to sleep. To guard against the attack, she must never overload the
stomach, nor take anything indigestible; and never think too much nor
allow herself to become excited or depressed.</p>

<p>When the trouble is caused by a too full habit, she must observe
the directions given in the articles on palpitation of the heart, and
Syncope. The diet must be mild and not too nutritious, the bowels must
be regularly moved every day, chiefly by Epsom Salts and Seidlitz
Powders, and regular gentle exercise must be taken in the open air.</p>

<p>In the latter months it is especially important to attend to a
severe headache <em>immediately</em>, particularly when the pain is
seated <em>at the top of the head</em>, because it is very likely, if
unchecked, to terminate in convulsions. The means above recommended
must be carefully and perseveringly applied; the feet must be kept
warm, the bowels freely opened, and the head kept cool by wet clothes,
or cold lotions, or ice. It is the general practice in all such cases,
if the pain does not abate soon, and the pulse be full and quick,
to bleed freely at the arm, and the most eminent physicians of the
Allopathic school assure us, that the life of the patient frequently
depends upon its being done promptly. I have no doubt, however, but
that relief can be generally obtained by the simple means described, if
they are used early and perseveringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388"
id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>


<h5>INSOMNIA, OR SLEEPLESSNESS.</h5>

<p>There are few affections that cause more real distress during
pregnancy than this. Many females will be utterly unable to sleep
for many days and nights together, and others can only obtain a few
minutes broken and unrefreshing sleep at distant intervals. There is
danger, when this state becomes highly aggravated, that it may lead to
delirium, or that the want of rest may wear away the strength to such a
degree, that the patient will sink from mere exhaustion. There are some
females, however, who will remain without sleep, or at most take but
very little, for a long time, without suffering any inconvenience.</p>

<p>This affection is essentially a nervous one, and the only means
likely to relieve it are those that have a tendency to soothe and
calm the nerves. If the patient be surrounded by any irritating
circumstances they should be at once removed, or she herself removed
from them. Particular attention must be paid to the diet, so that no
derangement of the stomach or bowels be kept up, and a regular system
of out-door exercise must be practised. A warm bath just before going
to bed, with a good rubbing of the skin, will frequently act like magic
in procuring rest. As a general rule narcotic drugs should not be used,
but in extreme cases they may be resorted to sparingly. A single Opium
pill, or a few drops of Laudanum may be taken after the bath. If the
patient be thin and delicate, she should eat meat, eggs, and milk,
and take a little wine, if it causes no unpleasant symptoms. Indeed a
glass of wine will frequently act better than Laudanum, and so will
ale with some, and coffee with others. If the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> patient be of a full
habit these things will be improper, and may injure. She should then be
kept quiet, and fed sparingly. <em>Music</em> has a powerful effect in
many of these cases:&mdash;a slow, solemn air, played while the patient
is reclining after her bath, seldom fails in inducing sleep.</p>


<h5>TEMPORARY AFFECTION OF THE SIGHT, HEARING, AND SMELL.</h5>

<p>These disorders are quite common during pregnancy, particularly in
the latter months. Some females will be utterly unable to distinguish
any odors, even the most powerful; others completely lose their taste,
and others again become deaf or blind. When they are caused only by the
sympathetic action of the womb, such deprivations are seldom of long
duration, though they may recur at frequent intervals. In some cases
they remain a considerable time, and great fear is felt that they may
become permanent, but there is little danger of such a result. I knew
a lady who suddenly lost her sight when about two months gone, and who
remained totally blind till about three hours after her delivery, when
her sight returned in a moment as perfect as before. The same thing
has frequently been observed of the other senses. In some cases the
vision will not be lost but perverted, and the patient will then see
everything double, or larger or smaller than natural, or always of a
wrong color. In like manner some will hear imaginary conversations, or
will fancy everybody is shouting, or perhaps only whispering, though
they are all the time speaking in their natural voice.</p>

<p>These perversions, when thus produced, need occasion no alarm,
and seldom require attention, unless<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span> accompanied by other
urgent symptoms. They may arise however, from a fullness of blood in
the head, in which case they are accompanied by a flushed face and
drowsiness, and are preceded by bright sparks flashing before the eyes,
or by ringing in the ears.</p>

<p>The treatment of all these affections should be the same as that
recommended for most of the previous derangements, particularly for
<em>Headache</em>, <em>Syncope</em>, and <em>Palpitation of the
Heart</em>. If there be nervous excitement merely, it must be calmed
in the same way as recommended in the articles referred to, and also
in the last one on sleeplessness. If the female be of a full habit,
and there is evidently a pressure of blood on the brain and nerves of
the special senses, the same means should be adopted to reduce the
system, and draw the blood to the extremities, that have already been
described.</p>

<p>In such cases these sudden deprivations of sight and hearing
sometimes indicate the commencement of Convulsions, or Apoplexy,
particularly if they occur during labor, when every means should be
resorted to <em>instantly</em> to relieve the pressure on the brain.
If no simpler means succeed in a reasonable time, it is the general
custom to bleed freely from the arm, and there is no question but
this frequently removes the difficulty at once, whatever objections
may be made to the practice. It is also proper to say that many
eminent practitioners, who are not advocates of the lancet in general,
strenuously urge that it should be used immediately if the sight or
hearing suddenly disappear in this way at any time. And I certainly
have myself known these accidents sometimes followed by a fit of
Apoplexy, or Convulsions, and even death. Such was the case with<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
a friend of one of my patients. She found one day, quite suddenly,
that she could only see <em>half</em> of any thing she looked at, and
at times it even disappeared altogether. Nothing was done for her,
and in about five hours after the first attack she fell speechless
and died before they could lift her upon the bed. It will therefore
be a necessary precaution, in all pregnant females of a full habit,
to attend rigidly to the advice that has been given, because
<em>simple</em> means, used in time, and regularly, may prevent the
necessity of stronger ones altogether. In purely nervous cases of this
kind no apprehension whatever need be felt, and no such practice as
bleeding is required.</p>


<h5>DISORDERED JUDGMENT, INCLINATIONS, AND PROPENSITIES.</h5>

<p>The sympathetic irritation of the uterus, in some females produces
extraordinary phenomena of this kind, from simple desire to the most
furious craving, and from mere caprice to actual insanity. There is
no doubt but that many of these unusual desires, or <em>longings</em>
as they are called, are either produced or much aggravated by the
imagination of the patient, and frequently would never be experienced
at all, if the idea was not suggested by other people having had
the same. Custom and imitation are very powerful in such cases,
particularly when the nervous sensibility is much exalted. Still the
most singular aberrations of this kind will often arise without any
such adventitious aid, and the fact should be borne in mind, so that
these temporary vagaries may be regarded with proper charity and
forbearance.</p>

<p>Some females will entirely change in their dispositions at these
times, the most amiable and mild becoming<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> positively ill-natured
and malicious;&mdash;the gentle will turn headstrong, the haughty and
proud will become humble, and the gay will become melancholy, or the
sad will madly seek every kind of gaiety. Such things however should
never be remembered, nor be brought up against them afterwards, for
truly at such times <em>they know not what they do!</em></p>

<p>Women have been known while in this state, to become thievish, or to
have an irresistible propensity to burn or kill. Some have even been
known to exhibit great talents for music or poetry, though ordinarily
without any capacity for such things. Some will suddenly exhibit a
most extraordinary intellect, while others will become quite silly.
A medical writer tells us an instance of one female who always had
an excellent sound judgment while pregnant, but <em>no memory</em>,
while in her ordinary state she had a poor judgment but <em>a most
extraordinary good memory</em>. The celebrated Baudelocque gives
an account of another who could scarcely eat anything but what she
<em>stole</em>, while going to market; and another writer mentions a
lady who longed till she was almost delirious to bite a piece out of
a baker's shoulder, who worked opposite her window. There is even an
account of one who longed to eat some of her husband, whom she dearly
loved, and who actually killed him to satisfy her appetite, and then
salted pieces of the body to keep for future use. A writer named Vives
also tells us of a female whose husband paid a large sum of money for
her to be allowed to bite a young man's neck, it being evident that
she would be nearly certain to miscarry unless so gratified. In the
year 1816, at Mons, in France, an unfortunate woman in this condition
was seized with an irresistible impulse<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span> to destroy her children,
and actually drowned three of them, and herself afterwards. She had
previously sent a poisoned cake also to one at school, but fortunately
it was not eaten.</p>

<p>Generally speaking all these things pass away with delivery, if not
before, unless it be actual insanity, which sometimes remains. All
that can be done is to attend strictly to the general health, keep the
skin, bowels, and stomach, in good action, and remove all depressing
or irritating circumstances. If there be a propensity to anything
decidedly injurious or dangerous, the patient must be strictly watched,
but without its being perceived or known by her, for fear of exciting
suspicion in those who would be disposed to be cunningly secret or
revengeful. Proper diet, regular bathing, and out-door exercise often
correct many of these things.</p>


<h5>HÆMOPTYSIS, HÆMATEMESIS AND EPISTAXIS.</h5>

<p>These three terms mean <em>spitting of blood</em>, <em>vomiting
of blood</em>, and <em>bleeding from the nose</em>, all of which
frequently occur during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Spitting of blood is most usually observed in nervous women,
and in those of a full habit. It is caused partly by sympathetic
irritation, and partly by the womb pressing upwards against the
diaphragm and lessening the size of the chest, which deranges the
circulation in the lungs, and causes rupture of their blood vessels.
The premonitory symptoms are pains round the waist, cold extremities,
creeping of the skin, and a sensation of anxiety or depression
round the heart. The attack begins by difficulty of breathing, heat
in the chest, and dry cough, followed by spitting up more or less
bloody frothy mucus; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394"
id="Page_394">[394]</a></span> which symptoms are much increased
by violent exercise, or a hot atmosphere. In ordinary cases a mere
spitting of blood need occasion no great alarm, unless attended by
symptoms of inflammation, or unless the patient has had cough, and
other indications of pulmonary derangement before conception.</p>

<p>In hæmatemesis the blood is vomited from the stomach, and is in
black clots, frequently mixed with the food, or bile, while that which
comes from the lungs in spitting on the contrary is bright red, and
quite fresh. In vomiting of blood also, there is seldom any cough or
exertion of any kind.</p>

<p>The treatment of spitting of blood must be nearly the same as for
many other derangements already described. When there is a full habit,
the patient must live low, keep the bowels free, and the skin in good
order, and avoid all agitation of mind or over exertion of body. An
Opium pill occasionally will be useful, or a few drops of laudanum. The
cough must be combatted in the way recommended in my previous article
on <em>Cough</em>. Lemonade or tamarind tea, with some Syrup of Poppies
added, may be freely drunk, or some of the black currant root tea. The
treatment of Hæmatemesis is precisely the same. Occasionally however
the blood will pass into the intestines and occasion colic, and then it
must be removed by administering an enema of starch and castor oil, or
a little manna may be taken.</p>

<p>Epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is much more frequent
than either of the preceding, but is seldom of much consequence.
In many cases in fact it is highly beneficial, as it relieves the
head from pressure, and thus obviates many inconveniences. If
it continue too long, or becomes excessive, it may generally be
arrested by putting cold wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395"
id="Page_395">[395]</a></span> cloths between the eyes, and on the
cheeks, while the head is kept elevated. The feet and hands should
be kept warm, and the air breathed should be as cold as possible. In
extreme cases, the nostrils may be plugged with bits of sponge, or
cotton, or some powdered alum may be snuffed up them. The best plan
is to raise the hands above the head and put something very cold,
as a lump of ice for instance, or a piece of cold iron, between the
shoulders; this seldom fails.</p>


<h5>VARICOSE VEINS.</h5>

<p>Very often in pregnant women the veins in different parts, but
particularly of the thighs and legs will swell out in knots, either
singly or in bunches, sometimes like strings of beads, or like the
links of a chain. These are called <em>Varices</em>, and occasionally
they attain a large size, and extend to various other portions of
the body, as the external lips, vagina, and mouth of the womb. Some
women in fact have them over nearly the whole body. They are caused
by the pressure of the womb on the large abdominal veins, preventing
the return of the blood and disturbing the balance of circulation
between the veins and arteries. In the majority of cases, unless very
large, they cause but little inconvenience, and may be let alone, but
sometimes they cause pain, or become so full that there is danger of
their bursting, and then it is necessary to interfere.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is to relieve the abdominal veins from
the pressure of the womb, and this may be done by the patient keeping
more or less the horizontal position, and carefully avoiding all
violent exertion. The swelling is always worse during the latter part
of the day, particularly if the woman has<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> been much on her feet,
she should therefore apply a cloth roller round the limbs before she
rises in the morning. If this be carefully put on, just tight enough
not to interfere with the motion of the limbs, nor totally obstruct
the circulation, it will prevent the varices to a great extent, if not
altogether. Brisk friction with the hand will disperse the swelling in
many persons, or warm fomentations, but sometimes <em>cold</em> bathing
answers better. It is advisable always to disperse them as soon as
possible, for if they remain too long that part of the vein becomes
permanently weakened by being overstretched, and will be always liable
to swell again from any slight cause. It is particularly advisable in
these cases to avoid constipation, and also to keep the skin in good
action by bathing and frictions.</p>

<p>If at any time one of these varices should burst, it need occasion
no alarm, unless it be seated on a large vein, and the bleeding
becomes profuse. To stop it, bind on firmly over the rent any firm
<em>cold</em> body, as a flat stone, or a large silver coin, passing
the bandage several times round. In slight cases a simple cold compress
will be sufficient, or a little powdered alum, or some vinegar and
water. In short any of the usual remedies for stopping bleeding from
wounds. The female must be quite still till it is stopped, and must be
careful when she begins to move about again, because it is liable to
break out afresh. Those of a very full habit must live low, and avoid
all stimulants, so as not to increase the quantity of blood in the body
more than is necessary. It is advisable to remove the varices, as much
as possible, before labor comes on, particularly if they are situated
on the lips, or in the vagina, because they may burst during delivery
and cause considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397"
id="Page_397">[397]</a></span> inconvenience, or even danger. It is
rare that these swellings continue after delivery, but if they should
do so, the same treatment must be persisted in as before.</p>


<h5>HÆMORRHOIDS, OR PILES.</h5>

<p>These are troublesome annoyances at any time, but particularly
during pregnancy, and unfortunately they are very common at that time.
They are, no doubt, chiefly caused in the same way as varicose veins,
that is by the enlarged womb preventing the proper flow of the blood
in the small veins, and so causing them to swell, and form tumors.
They may in fact be called varices, as truly so as those on the limbs.
In many persons however they are undoubtedly brought on merely by
<em>Constipation</em>, which will undoubtedly either cause them or make
them much worse when otherwise produced. In general they become worse
as the pregnancy advances, because the womb becomes larger and the
bowels are more apt to be confined.</p>

<p>As long as they only cause inconvenience, without any particular
distress or urgent symptom, they may be let alone, or be slightly
treated in the way of palliation, till after delivery, when they
will disappear. Occasionally however, they grow to a large size, so
as to hinder the passage of the bowels, and prevent the patient from
sitting down or walking. They may then cause inflammation, and bring
on falling of the intestine, or abortion, by the straining which they
necessitate when the bowels are moved. And even if these extreme
results do not follow, there may be serious derangements of the
general health, indicated by difficulty of breathing, sleeplessness,
headache, and fever. In short there are few of the derangements<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
incident to pregnancy so annoying as this, and unfortunately, from its
nature, the sufferer dislikes to speak of it and seek the necessary
assistance. Many prefer undergoing the most excruciating agony for
months, rather than complain, which shows the necessity for females
knowing how to treat themselves, when possible.</p>

<p>The bleeding which sometimes takes place from Piles is more often
beneficial than otherwise, unless it becomes excessive, from rupture
of a large vessel, in which case, if the wound is external, it may be
treated the same as the ruptured varicose vein; if it be internal, the
remedies must be injected with a syringe, or a large roll of lint or
cotton may be soaked in alum water and passed up the rectum. Frequently
bathing the thighs and perineum with cold water will be sufficient.</p>

<p>To relieve the pain and swelling, the female should sit over the
steam of hot water, and use the warm bath. If the piles are external,
they should be bathed with hot milk and Laudanum, or rubbed with
any soothing ointment, particularly the <em>Cucumber Ointment</em>,
mentioned in my Diseases of Woman, or with <em>Stramonium
Ointment</em>. If they are internal the milk and Laudanum should be
injected if possible, or some thin starch and Laudanum, and a stiff
roll of cloth may be smeared with the ointment and introduced. In
general, ointments or other greasy matters are not so good as the
milk or starch. In conjunction with this, the bowels must be kept
free, either with enemas or castor oil, or by using a seidlitz
powder in the morning. This is indispensable, for if constipation
exists, no applications can render much service. The patient must
also avoid fatigue, and not remain too long upon her feet, nor
sit long, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399"
id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> on a hard seat, and if she be of a full
habit she must live low, to avoid making too much blood. It is also
important, at all times, to avoid using drastic purgatives, such as
Aloes, Colocynth, or Gamboge, as they always make piles much worse, or
even cause them.</p>


<h5>ŒDEMA, OR WATERY SWELLINGS.</h5>

<p>This affection also appears, like the preceding, to arise from
obstructed circulation, but instead of the blood accumulating it is
merely the serum, or watery portion of it. The swellings are generally
whitish, and spread about, and a small pit remains in them when pressed
with the finger. They are found on various parts of the lower limbs,
and on the groin or abdomen, and also upon the external lips, in which
place they are often exceedingly troublesome. As a general rule these
swellings are of small account, and as they disappear with delivery,
but little attention need be bestowed upon them. Sometimes, however,
they become very extensive, and so engorged that they inflame and are
extremely painful. They have even been known to mortify, and cause
considerable sloughing, particularly when chafed and afterwards wet
with the urine. In these extreme cases there may be serious disturbance
of the general health, from the constant irritation, and from the
patient being unable to walk about. I have often known the limbs and
vulva covered with patches of Erysipelas from this cause. Sometimes the
swellings even become so large that they interfere with the process of
delivery.</p>

<p>The treatment of this affection consists in rest, particularly
lying down, saline purgatives, regular, and frequent washing the
parts with cold milk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400"
id="Page_400">[400]</a></span> Laudanum, or with a solution of
Borax, half an ounce to a pint of water, to be used cold and with a
tea-spoonful of Laudanum added to it. Simple cold water is frequently
quite sufficient. In general all kinds of ointments are injurious, but
if other means fail to give relief, the <em>Cucumber Ointment</em>
may be tried. The wash should always be used after urinating, and
the parts must not be rubbed, but lightly dried with a piece of soft
linen. Fullers earth is often an excellent application when there is
chafing.</p>

<p>If the patient be of a full habit, she must carefully diet herself,
and bathe regularly. If she be thin and weak, a generous diet will be
advisable, with meat and even a little wine.</p>


<h5>HYDRORRHEA, OR PROFUSE DISCHARGE OF WATER.</h5>

<p>This consists in a discharge of water, more or less profuse, from
the vagina, at various periods during pregnancy. Some females will
only discharge a small quantity, at intervals, others will have a
constant dropping, and others again will pour out an immense quantity,
sometimes several pints, or even quarts, in the course of a few days.
In general this water is quite limpid and colorless, but sometimes it
contains much mucus, and at other times it is tinged with blood. It
does not appear that this discharge leads to any evil result, even when
excessive, and I only refer to it to relieve anxiety. The origin of
this water is not yet ascertained, but it is generally thought to be
secreted between the membranes and the womb, and to be quite distinct
from the liquor amnii.</p>


<h5>PUSTULES, AND MUCOUS DISCHARGES.</h5>

<p>Occasionally the external lips will be covered with<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
pustules during pregnancy, and frequent discharges of mucus will occur
from the vagina. They are both however caused by the unusual action of
the uterine system, and merely require frequent bathing of the parts
with milk and Laudanum, and regular action of the bowels. The most
important thing to remark in connection with them is that they have
often been mistaken, even by medical men, for the effects of syphilitic
disease, and much distress has resulted from such mistakes.</p>


<h5>DERANGEMENTS OF THE URINARY ORGANS.</h5>

<p>Several derangements of the urinary organs are liable to occur
during pregnancy, partly from sympathetic irritation, and partly from
mere pressure. Some of these may be partially relieved, others have to
be borne as patiently as they can be till delivery removes them.</p>

<p>The swollen womb often presses on the neck of the bladder, and
hinders the passage of the urine, or even obstructs it sometimes
altogether, and thus causes straining, burning heat, and great
distension of the bladder. In some instances this passes off as the
pregnancy advances, owing to the womb rising higher in the abdomen,
but in other cases it remains more or less, during the whole term.
It is particularly important, in such cases, that the female should
not let the difficulty remain too long unremedied, for if the bladder
be very full it may become utterly impossible to empty it by natural
effort. Sometimes the difficulty is much lessened by lying on the back
a short time before attempting to urinate, or by raising up the abdomen
with the hand at the time. Many females can urinate with tolerable
comfort while lying on the back or abdomen, and others are much<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
relieved by constantly wearing a bandage. Constipation always makes
this difficulty worse, and sometimes even causes it, by keeping the
rectum full and thus increasing the pressure. In all such cases it
will be readily seen, that forcing medicines are not only useless, but
liable to cause injury. The change of position, rest, and supporting
the abdomen are the means to be relied upon. If these fail, and
the urine accumulates, the catheter must be used. A warm bath, or
fomentation with warm water and Laudanum, will assist, and sometimes
relieve alone. To ease the burning and distress the patient must drink
freely of gum water, or barley tea, with a little Syrup of Poppies.</p>

<p>There is one manœuvre which, if practised aright, will nearly always
allow the female to urinate with ease, and fortunately she can practise
it herself. It consists in introducing two of the fingers into the
vagina, and raising up the womb, as if practising the <i lang="fr"
xml:lang="fr">ballotment</i>. This removes the pressure from the bladder,
and the urine then escapes by natural effort. A few trials will soon
enable any one to do this, particularly if they notice well the form
and position of the parts, as shown in the plates of this work. A lady
who heard me mention this in one of my Lectures, afterwards stated
that the knowledge of it enabled her to dispense altogether with the
catheter, which she was previously necessitated to use during most of
her pregnancy.</p>

<p>When there is merely a nervous irritation causing the difficulty,
the warm bath, or fomentation with warm water and Laudanum will be
sufficient, or a little Belladonna Ointment may be rubbed over the
meatus urinarius, while some starch and Laudanum is injected carefully
into the vagina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403"
id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>


<h5>CRAMPS.</h5>

<p>These arise from the womb pressing on the nerves of the sacrum, and
are therefore not under the control of medicine. All that can be done
is to change the position of the body as much as possible, from lying
down to standing up, and by turning from one side to another. Brisk
rubbing with the hand will also assist in giving relief. The cramps
however usually disappear after delivery, and must therefore be borne
as patiently as possible till that takes place.</p>


<h5>PRURITUS, OR ITCHING OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS.</h5>

<p>Having treated this affection fully in my <cite>Diseases of
Woman</cite>, I cannot do better than extract the article from that
work on the subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This disease, though not so immediately dangerous as some others,
is perhaps the most distressing that can be met with.</p>

<p>"It consists in an intolerable and incessant itching of the parts,
which nothing seems to allay. Sometimes it is so bad that the female
is almost tormented to death; she cannot see company, or walk out,
and often shuts herself up alone in her agony. Many have fainted from
it, and some have even become delirious. I have seen patients whose
hands it was necessary to tie, to prevent them tearing themselves to
pieces.</p>

<p>"The causes of pruritus appear to be most of those that produce
simple inflammation, which it very frequently accompanies or precedes.
Pregnant females are very liable to it, and in some it will continue,
in spite of all that can be done, till after delivery, when<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span> it
usually disappears. I have known it produce abortion. Some females
always have it at the menstrual period, and others during nursing.
Occasionally there is a little eruption attending it, but not always,
though the parts are generally swollen and red. Parasites are sometimes
the exciting cause, and should always be destroyed immediately.</p>

<p>"The treatment consists in first attending strictly to the diet,
which must be light and unirritating, and to the regular action of
the bowels and womb; and in using the cooling washes and lotions
before mentioned. If the itching still continues, use either of the
following washes to the parts:&mdash;Sub. carbonate of potash three
drachms, water four ounces; put a tea-spoonful of this into a quart
of warm water, and use it three times a day.&mdash;A tea-spoonful
of Eau de Cologne to a pint of warm water.&mdash;Sulphate of Zinc,
half a tea-spoonful to a quart of warm water. Both these may be used
many times in the day.&mdash;Borax half an ounce, Sulphate of Morphia
six grains; pure water half a pint. This last seldom fails of giving
relief. It should be applied three or four times a day, with a piece
of soft linen, the parts being first washed with warm soap and water.
A tea-spoonful of laudanum will sometimes answer as well as the six
grains of Sulphate of Morphia.</p>

<p>"Caustic has been employed, and blisters to the inside of the
thighs, but such violent remedies are seldom either necessary or
serviceable. I have known the parts to be deeply scarified with the
lancet, and even burnt with a <em>red hot iron</em>, without at all
alleviating the pruritus.</p>

<p>"In young persons it seems to be often produced by constipation,
worms, and gravel; but it most probably depends, essentially,
on some impurity, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405"
id="Page_405">[405]</a></span> irritating quality, in the blood, or in
the natural secretions of the parts, which should therefore never be
allowed to remain long unwashed.</p>

<p>"Sitting in cold water, and the application of ice to the parts, has
given relief. I have also effected many cures, almost instantaneously,
by means of a small <em>Galvanic plate</em>, so constructed as to be
worn just within the vulva.</p>

<p>"All remedies must of course be applied with caution during
pregnancy; and it must be recollected that sometimes the disease
<em>will</em> continue, more or less, till after delivery, though the
distress from it may be much alleviated."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXVII.</h4>

<h5>IDIOPATHIC, OR PRIMARY DISEASES INCIDENT TO PREGNANCY.</h5>


<h5>FLOODING, OR HEMORRHAGE.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Flooding</span> is one of the most dangerous
accidents that occur during pregnancy, its consequences being often
of the most serious character. The causes that lead to flooding are
very numerous, some of them predisposing to it, and others immediately
exciting it. Among these may be mentioned a too full habit, violent
exertion, falls, coughing, vomiting, straining from costiveness or
violent purgatives, forcing medicines, criminal attempts at abortion,
overwalking, blows on the abdomen, too much dancing, or running up
stairs, strong mental emotions, fright, or anger, and <em>certain
excesses</em>. The immediate cause is the separation of the membrane in
which the fœtus is inclosed from the walls of the womb. Flooding may
however result from the placenta growing over the mouth of the womb,
and being torn as that opens&mdash;usually about the sixth or seventh
month.&mdash;(See the article <em>Flooding</em> during Labor.)</p>

<p>In most cases flooding is preceded by dull pain in the loins and
groins, and a sensation of weight and dragging. Similar sensations
however are often produced by other causes, which makes it difficult
to predicate, with any degree of certainty, whether the patient
is about to flood or not. The very first appearance of blood from
the vagina must therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407"
id="Page_407">[407]</a></span> be watched for carefully, as that
removes all doubt, and warns us to be prompt with the proper remedies.
Sometimes a female will flood internally, the blood being retained by
the passage being closed or plugged up by clots, or by its passing
behind the membranes, or under the centre of the placenta. These
internal or concealed hemorrhages are very dangerous, as the patient
may lose much blood before her condition is suspected. It is therefore
necessary to bear this in mind, and carefully use every means to
ascertain whether such an accident has occurred or not. In general the
indications are pretty plain, the patient suffering from deep seated
and distressing pains in the back and groins, with great weakness in
the limbs, faintness, weak pulse, dimness of sight, ringing in the
ears, coldness of the hands and feet, swelling of the abdomen, and
finally fainting, particularly if the retained blood suddenly escapes,
which it usually does.</p>

<p>In the early months there is more danger to the child from flooding
than there is to the mother, because it is nearly certain to lead to
abortion. In the latter months, on the contrary, the mother runs the
greatest risk, as the child may then live if it be expelled, while the
mother may sink and die from excessive loss of blood. There are many
females of a very full habit, who suffer but little from hemorrhage,
unless it be excessive, indeed some seem to be benefitted by it, and
are thus relieved from headache and convulsions. It should, however, be
carefully watched, and its effects duly noted.</p>

<p>The treatment of flooding must depend materially upon its
severity, and the time when it occurs. In the early months, when
the discharge is slight, and when it causes little distress,
simple means will answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408"
id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> The patient must lie on her back, on a
hard mattress, with the pelvis raised, by means of a pillow, higher
than the rest of the body. The air must be kept fresh and cool around
her; she must keep herself quiet in body and mind, live rather low, and
drink freely of cooling drinks, such as soda water, lemonade, tamarind
tea, or ice water. [The fullest directions for making and using all
these drinks will be found in my "Diseases of Woman."]</p>

<p>If the flooding does not stop with these simple means, external
applications must be made, of cold, wet cloths, or even ice, over the
abdomen, and inside the thighs. Finally, if further treatment is still
needed, cold astringent injections may be carefully thrown into the
vagina. Cold water is perhaps as good as anything for this purpose,
and I have frequently known a most severe flooding checked immediately
by injecting cold water into the vagina and rectum, and applying cold
wet cloths over the abdomen, and inside the thighs. Some astringent
drink may also assist, such as a little syrup of comfrey, or extract
of Rhatany, and particularly a tea made of the root of the black
currant, as recommended in my "Diseases of Woman."&mdash;[A handful of
the root may be boiled in two quarts of water, for twenty minutes; it
should be sweetened to taste and drunk freely. The common blackberry,
or the dew berry, is also excellent, though not so good as the black
currant.]&mdash;If the patient be nervous and irritable, or suffer much
from pain, an opium pill may be taken, or from ten to twenty drops of
laudanum.</p>

<p>The general practice in these cases is to <em>bleed</em> freely
and <em>give opium!</em> And as this practice certainly does
succeed in many extreme cases, I should certainly recommend, if the
simpler means fail, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409"
id="Page_409">[409]</a></span> resort to it at once. I dislike bleeding
very much, in any cases, and here it seems particularly inappropriate;
I should therefore say <em>try almost anything and everything
first</em>, but never obstinately refuse to do it if nothing else
succeeds.</p>

<p>In some cases a plug or tampon is used, to fill up the vagina. It
may be made of a roll of cloth, cotton, or a piece of sponge. This
practice, however, is useless in the latter months of pregnancy, and
very often fails even at other times. When it succeeds it causes the
blood to coagulate, and thus closes up the mouths of the vessels. Quite
as often, however, it only keeps it in, and makes it accumulate in the
womb till it all rushes away at once; still it may be tried.</p>

<p>If the hemorrhages should occur so frequently, or be so excessive,
in spite of all treatment, as to endanger the safety of the patient,
there is no other resource left to save her life but to produce
abortion, because the presence of the fœtus and its appendages is
evidently then the irritating cause which keeps up the discharge, and
it cannot be expected to stop till the womb is emptied.</p>


<h5>ABORTION, OR MISCARRIAGE.</h5>

<p>When the fœtus is prematurely expelled before it can survive,
it is called an <em>Abortion</em>, but if its expulsion take place
so late that it can live, it is called <em>Miscarriage</em>. Both
these are serious accidents. In abortion the child is lost, as a
matter of course, but in miscarriage it may live, after the seventh
month. The danger to the mother is considerable from both, though
greatest probably from abortion. It is probable that many very early
miscarriages take place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410"
id="Page_410">[410]</a></span> unperceived, the female suffering but
little from the accident, and the embryo being too small to be seen,
unless carefully looked for.</p>

<p>The most frequent periods for such accidents are found to be six
months, five months, and three months; and what is very singular, a
much greater number of male children are aborted than females, the
proportion being about sixteen to eleven.</p>

<p>These accidents are so intimately connected with flooding, that many
writers always treat of them together, considering the flooding merely
as the most frequent cause and symptom of miscarriage or abortion. In
speaking therefore of the immediate causes of premature expulsion of
the fœtus, we place hemorrhage first, and the causes before enumerated
which produce that as being its most frequent remote ones.</p>

<p>A full habit, with tendency to local congestion, seems to predispose
a female very much to miscarriage; every one so constituted should
carefully avoid luxurious living and an inactive life. Violent bodily
exertion, falls, or blows, or strong mental excitement are most usually
the immediate causes, though with some it will come on spontaneously
without any such exciting agencies. Some females will miscarry many
times in succession, and always so near the same period, that they
can tell to a day or two when it will happen. It seems to become a
habit of the womb with them to contract at that particular time,
and the only way to break through the <em>habit</em> is for them to
avoid becoming pregnant for some considerable time, say two or three
years after, they may then go the full time, but will seldom do so if
they conceive immediately after having miscarried. In some persons
miscarriage is caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411"
id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> a <em>too eager</em> gratification of
certain desires; but in others it may arise <em>from the opposite
cause</em>.</p>

<p>There is a disease of the womb also by no means unfrequent, though
but little understood, which undoubtedly causes much miscarriage, and
that is <em>Rheumatism of the Womb!</em> This mostly exists before the
pregnancy however, and should be then treated according to the plan
laid down in my "Diseases of Woman."</p>

<p>Miscarriage also arises in many females from a rigid state of the
muscular fibres of the womb, which not relaxing sufficiently to allow
that organ to expand become irritated by the pressure they experience,
and begin to contract. This contraction of the womb of course soon
leads to the expulsion of its contents, the same as in real labor.
Women with their first children are more liable to miscarriage than
others on this account, the womb not having become habituated as it
were to the necessary relaxation.</p>

<p>And this is the reason also why some females, after suffering
from this accident many times in succession at last escape it. In
general they miscarry early the first time, from the womb not relaxing
sufficiently, but go a little longer the next time, and longer still
the next, and so on till they reach the full period. The fibres of
the womb have gradually become accustomed to relax, and have borne
the irritation longer and longer each pregnancy, till at last they
have forborne to contract till the proper time. I knew one female who
miscarried <em>twenty-one times</em> in succession, getting gradually
nearer to the full period each time, till at last she reached <em>nine
months</em>, and was rewarded with a living child.</p>

<p>Sometimes the accident may be produced by a uterine tumor, by a
great quantity of water in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412"
id="Page_412">[412]</a></span> womb, or even by there being more than
one child, because in either of these cases there is required more room
than ordinary; and of course from the greater expansion required, the
liability is increased. Various womb diseases may also be mentioned
as causes, or adhesions of its walls or ligaments to the walls of
the abdomen, and also a diseased state of the placenta. The pressure
of corsets and tight dresses also not unfrequently lead to the same
result. Some general diseases undoubtedly often cause miscarriage, such
as measles, jaundice, scarlet fever, consumption, and probably many
others, particularly those in which the quality of the blood is much
altered, or the nervous power much exalted or depressed. Convulsions
have already been mentioned as being frequent causes of miscarriage,
and all strong mental or moral impressions. Indeed these last causes
operate more than is suspected, and make it necessary for a pregnant
female to be kept as calm in her mind as it is possible for her to be.
I have even known one to miscarry from a fright <em>in a dream</em>.</p>

<p>It is also a fact, though not generally known, that there are
certain diseases <em>of the father</em> that may produce miscarriage,
and unfortunately they are of that kind that often remain for a long
time in the system without much external manifestation, so that many
persons think they are perfectly free from them even while they are
working such mischief.</p>

<p>The death of the child also is sure to produce miscarriage, and
this may result from various causes, such as external injuries and
violence, or from remaining too long in the warm bath and thereby
causing congestion of blood in the womb. Small pox and syphilis in the
mother may also cause the death of the child,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> though not always. Many
having been born at full term with these diseases upon them.</p>

<p>In general the fœtus is expelled very soon after it dies, but
occasionally it is retained for a considerable time, and may not
pass away till it is completely decayed. It has even been known to
become almost fluid, and several months elapse before it was entirely
expelled. Most women know when it dies, by its seeming to fall down to
the bottom of the abdomen, like a dull weight, and also by its feeling
very <em>cold</em>. Very often, however, there is no indication of
its death whatever. M. Chailly mentions a case where the embryo died,
probably when about fifteen days old, but the placenta continued to
grow, and the lady was delivered when about six months and a half gone
of the dead embryo, only about a quarter of an inch in length, though
the after-birth was nearly large enough for one of the usual size. In
this case it had died but not decayed, and remained in the womb six
months and a half. In cases of twins also, one will sometimes die at an
early period, but remain till the other is born at full term.</p>

<p>The <em>growth of the placenta over the mouth of the womb</em>,
and <em>shortness of the chord</em>, have already been referred to as
causes both of flooding and miscarriage; and to these may be added
monstrous or deformed fœtuses, which rarely reach the full term.</p>

<p>It is probable that there are many constitutional and individual
peculiarities predisposing to miscarriage, with which we are not
much acquainted, and which may account for the constant occurrence
of that accident in many females, notwithstanding all we can
do. A <em>scrofulous</em> taint is with good reason supposed to
be one of these, and it is probable that the <em>disease of the
placenta</em>, and its consequent separation from the womb, before
referred to, is mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414"
id="Page_414">[414]</a></span> caused by a taint of this kind. In many
instances, where a female has miscarried from no apparent cause, if the
placenta be carefully examined it will be found dotted here and there
with diseased spots, sometimes <em>like scrofulous sores!</em> It is
advisable always to ascertain this, and to carefully examine the fœtus
and its appendages. In all cases the advice I gave to <em>keep from
being pregnant for some time</em>, will be found most likely to succeed
in averting the accident, both because it gives the womb time to regain
its strength and break through its <em>habit</em>, and also because it
gives us time to operate upon the constitutional taint, if there be
reason to suppose it exists.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, but one often observed, that <em>living in
certain localities</em> even predisposes to miscarriage. There is a
certain district in France where the females are so liable to it, that
all who can do so leave the place when they become pregnant, and thus
escape the greater risk. Miscarriage also becomes epidemic at certain
times, and prevails like contagious diseases; several instances of this
are recorded in history.</p>

<p>Bleeding is also supposed to be a cause of abortion, and probably
it may lead to it in certain states of the system, but by no means
so certainly as many suppose. Instances have been known of pregnant
females being bled from ten to twenty times without any evil result,
even though carried so far as to make them faint. Mauriceau tells
us of one who was bled <em>ninety</em> times, and yet was delivered
of a healthy living child at full term. In like manner many other
ordinary causes of abortion will often fail entirely of their usual
effects. Thus Mauriceau informs us that a female seven months gone
fell upon the hard pavement from <em>a three story window</em>
and broke her arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415"
id="Page_415">[415]</a></span> but yet did not miscarry. Madame
Lachapelle also tells us of a young pregnant woman who threw herself
down stairs purposely, from fear that she should have to submit to
the Cesarean operation, she having a deformed pelvis. The fall caused
her death soon after, but did not make her miscarry. Certain powerful
medicines are also taken by some, a very small quantity of which, in
most cases, produces abortion immediately, but without effecting what
they desire, though it sometimes poisons themselves.</p>

<p>Indeed the power which the womb sometimes exhibits to retain its
contents in spite of the most violent disturbing agencies, is truly
astonishing. Cases have been known even where the womb itself has been
severely wounded, and yet miscarriage did not take place; as in the
case of a poor country-woman whom I heard of, who accidentally fell
upon a sharp wooden stake, and run it far into the body, injuring the
womb in a terrible manner, but strange to say, though far advanced
in pregnancy, she recovered and went safely through her full time. I
have often known women begin to flood and suffer from dreadful pain,
with other common symptoms of abortion, as early as the second month,
and yet they went safely the full time, though these signs continued
the whole time. In some cases the waters have even been partially
discharged, and yet abortion did not result. M. Velpeau tells us of an
instance where the bag of waters broke, in a female six months gone,
and one arm of the child even came down into the vagina, and yet the
arm returned, the discharge ceased, and she went her full term.</p>

<p>The <em>progress of a miscarriage</em> varies according to the
time at which it occurs, and the causes from which it arises. When it
results from any violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416"
id="Page_416">[416]</a></span> or accident, it usually takes place in
a short time, and is preceded by abundant flooding, which comes on
immediately. The discharge of blood however, is lesser the nearer we
approach the full term, so that a female six months gone is not in
nearly so much danger from flooding as one only two or three months
gone. The reason is this, in the early months nearly the whole of the
fœtal membranes are attached to the womb, so that in case of their
being separated, it bleeds from nearly all its internal surface, but
in the latter months the only point of attachment is the placenta.
In the latter months also the womb contracts vigorously, and so
closes its vessels, but in the early months its contractions are
comparatively feeble. In those cases also, where the child has been
dead a considerable time before its expulsion, there is seldom much
flooding, the connection between it and the mother having been more or
less destroyed by decay of the parts. The same result mostly follows a
miscarriage from internal disease, particularly of the placenta. Indeed
in some of these cases, the blood-vessels connecting the fœtus with the
mother have been so completely destroyed, that no blood whatever could
escape from them.</p>

<p>In regard to the probable consequences of premature delivery, it
has already been remarked that it is more dangerous in the early
months than the latter. It may also be added that it is much more
dangerous, at any time, when caused by violence of any kind, or by
forcing medicines, than when it occurs naturally. The danger is
much increased if it occurs during fever, or any eruptive disease,
or if the patient be suffering from diarrhœa or convulsions. As a
general rule we may say, in all cases, that miscarriage or abortion
is always more dangerous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417"
id="Page_417">[417]</a></span> mother and child than natural labor,
both in its present and in its future consequences. During an attack
of jaundice an abortion may terminate fatally in a few hours; and very
frequently the trouble with the after treatment is very great and
long-continued.</p>

<p>The treatment in an accident of this kind must vary according as we
are required to prevent it, or to remedy the evils that follow when it
has occurred.</p>

<p>If an abortion be threatened from any cause, the same general
practice must be adopted as recommended for <em>flooding</em>, the
indications being the same. I believe myself that in most cases,
except from accidental violence or internal disease, miscarriage
may be averted. I knew a lady who had miscarried many times, always
at the same period, who avoided it at last by simply <em>preventing
constipation</em> from the first commencement of pregnancy, and by
using an enema every evening of warm starch and water, pretty thick,
with about thirty drops of laudanum. This was administered by means of
a common injection pipe, just before going to bed, and continued till
after she had quickened, and repeated occasionally after that, if she
felt any premonitory symptoms of uterine disturbance. If the patient
be of a full habit, she should also, <em>from the very beginning</em>,
live low, keep the bowels free, and the skin in good action, and take
gentle regular exercise in the open air.</p>

<p>When all the means used are found of no avail, and it becomes
evident that the fœtus must be expelled, every endeavor should be used
to assist nature in its removal as early and as safely as possible. For
this purpose the same treatment, as far as practicable, must be pursued
as in a real labor. If the hand can be conveniently introduced, without
undue force, it may be so, to remove clots, or to take hold<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span> of
any part of the fœtus which may present, and assist in its extraction.
In the early months considerable help may be given, sometimes by
introducing the finger into the mouth of the womb, with a little
extract of Belladonna, to promote its relaxation, but no <em>force</em>
must be exerted in doing so. If any part of the after-birth can be
laid hold of it should be withdrawn, but no extraordinary effort must
be used to reach it. Frequently it happens that a portion of the
after-birth remains in spite of all attempts to take it away, and there
is a <em>possibility</em> that it may produce inflammation of the
womb, but no very serious apprehensions need be felt of such a result,
providing the patient is properly attended to in other respects. The
retained portion gradually decays, and passes away, merely occasioning
inconvenience and being very offensive. The danger from leaving it
except at a very late period, is generally thought to be less than that
from using any forcible means to remove it.</p>

<p>The best means for correcting the offensive discharge are cleansing
and antiseptic injections. Warm soap suds are very good, or a decoction
of Peruvian bark in water. Strong <em>coffee</em> is also excellent, or
a weak solution of chloride of lime. The bowels must be kept free, and
the skin carefully cleansed and well rubbed. On all occasions when the
hand can be introduced with moderate and safe efforts it should be so,
and the after-birth removed.</p>

<p>In conclusion it should be remarked, that the tendency to miscarry,
like many female diseases, is undoubtedly owing, in great part, to the
general debility and weakness which characterizes so many women at
the present day, and which is brought on chiefly by neglect of their
physical education when girls, and by their artificial mode of life
afterwards.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h4>

<h5>DISEASES OF CHILDBED.</h5>


<h5>PUERPERAL FEVER, OR CHILDBED FEVER.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is undoubtedly the most serious
of all those maladies that so often follow labor. It appears from
medical records that puerperal fever has been known from very remote
times, and that it has frequently become <em>epidemic</em>, or has
spread from one to another, like the Cholera. In hospitals this has
often been observed, and also in cities, sometimes almost every female
delivered in the place having been attacked while it prevailed. There
is also no doubt but that it is <em>contagious</em>, or capable of
being transmitted from one person to another, like small pox. Numerous
instances have been known where nurses and physicians have conveyed
it to all whom they attended, during a long period after having been
with a single case. One physician, after attending a case of puerperal
fever, lost nine patients successively from the same disease, before
he suspected the cause, and an old nurse assured me, that when she
was a young woman, she was the unfortunate means of conveying it to
two females whom she visited, by merely having been in the room a
short time with one who was suffering from it. It is therefore highly
important that all persons who may happen to be with a female so
affected should not attend another case of childbirth for some time,
and particularly that they should not wear any portion of the same
clothing they had then on, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span> should bathe the whole
body several times. If a case occurs in a hospital or other public
institution, the female must be carefully isolated from all the others,
and none of her attendants must be permitted on any account, to visit
other puerperal patients, till after a sufficient time has elapsed, and
every precaution has been taken.</p>

<p>The causes that produce this terrible disorder are not very well
understood; some of them probably predispose to it before delivery,
or even before pregnancy, while others are connected with labor and
its consequences. Among the former may be mentioned, improper diet,
an inactive life, anxiety of mind, bad air, a damp situation, a
full habit, or great weakness, the frequent use of stimulants, and
<em>certain excesses!</em> The principal causes operating immediately
are difficult labors, violent treatment, the use of instruments,
tearing away the placenta too soon, retention of the lochia, cold,
rising from the bed too soon, depression or excitement of the
mind, over exertion in talking to and seeing company, and neglect
of cleanliness. The most frequent cause probably is cold or damp,
which checks the lochia and the perspiration, and leads directly to
inflammation. It is on this account that the complaint is nearly
always worse in winter than in summer, and prevails most in low
damp situations, and in badly ventilated apartments, or in those
insufficiently warmed. In most warm countries, and in those of an
equable temperature, where the females remain much in the open air,
and use regular exercise, puerperal fever appears to be but little
known.</p>

<p>The nature of this complaint appears to be a severe and sudden
inflammation, commencing either in the womb or some of the
neighboring parts, which, if not arrested, rapidly extends to all
the organs of the pelvis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422"
id="Page_422">[422]</a></span> and abdomen, and hastens to a fatal
termination with fearful speed. The precise seat, and place of
commencement, of the inflammation, varies in different cases, but
this makes little difference either in the symptoms, consequences,
or treatment of the disease, and it is of but little use to give a
separate name to all these various forms. Uterine Phlebitis, Metro
Peritonitis, Puerperal Metritis, and Puerperal Peritonitis, are all
essentially the same complaint, and identical with what is called
Puerperal, or Childbed fever.</p>

<p>The disease generally appears from the second to the fifth day after
delivery, but may be delayed as late as the fifteenth or twentieth day,
or commences as early as two or three hours after; and has even been
known to show itself before labor came on.</p>

<p>It usually begins with headache, general debility, uneasy feelings,
creeping of the flesh, and chills: then follow tremblings, numbness of
the limbs, cold feet and hands, with a burning heat in the body. The
abdomen gradually gets tender, so that it cannot bear the slightest
pressure, sharp pains are felt in various parts of it, and the patient
continually complains of twisting and burning within. She prefers
to lie on her back, with the head raised and the knees drawn up, so
as to relax the abdominal muscles. Very soon she complains of great
thirst, and cries out repeatedly from the sharpness of the pain; the
headache increases, and the breathing becomes laborious. Hiccough
generally occurs at an early stage, and is usually accompanied
or followed by vomiting and diarrhœa, but sometimes by obstinate
constipation. The abdomen continues to swell, and becomes still
more tender, the face is pale, bathed with cold perspiration, and
indicates in every line the anxiety and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span> suffering under which
the patient labors. The features seem to be drawn upwards, and all
together, or <em>pinched up</em>, and indeed the whole body seems
to <em>shrink</em>. In general the lochial discharge either stops
altogether or lessens very much, the breasts remain empty or nearly so,
and the pulse is weak and irregular. In some few cases however, the
lochia continues to flow, or even increases, and the breasts remain
full up to the time of death. The urine is high colored and thick, and
causes smarting and burning as it passes away. The tongue furs and
becomes pointed, and pale colored. The eyes often seem much engorged,
and the white part become yellow, as indeed the skin does over the
whole body, owing to derangement of the bile, and alteration in the
character of the blood. In most cases the mind retains its faculties
nearly till dissolution, but there is frequently a vague sense of
uneasiness and fear, with great depression of spirits and weeping. Some
even feel assured, from the beginning, that they will never recover,
and occasionally become delirious.</p>

<p>The duration of this disorder varies considerably, though in most
cases it carries off the sufferer in a short time, frequently even in
two or three days. It may however last five, ten, or twelve days, and
has been known to do so fourteen.</p>

<p>The manner in which it terminates is also different in different
cases. The fluid resulting from the inflammation may either be
absorbed, or suppuration may ensue, and the matter be discharged,
either from one of the natural passages or from an artificial
opening; or it may not be discharged at all. Sometimes gangrene or
mortification ensues, and sometimes the inflammation partly subsides
and becomes chronic. When it terminates by resolution, which<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
is the most favorable mode, the patient begins to improve about the
fourth or fifth day; the pains become less acute, the swelling and
tenderness become less, and the milk, lochia, and other secretions
that were suppressed begin to reappear. The patient is also able to
lie either on the back or sides, and soon feels conscious herself that
she is improving. But even when a turn for the better has decidedly
taken place, too much confidence should not be prematurely felt, nor
should there be any relaxation of attention, for the slightest causes
may bring back all the symptoms with more than their former severity.
When suppuration ensues, which is most commonly the case, a mass of
fluid forms in the womb or abdomen, and is plainly indicated, either
by its moving about or by a portion escaping from the body. In this
case also the pain and tenderness decreases, and the abdomen seems less
hard, but the pulse becomes weaker, a sense of weight is felt about
the womb, the extremities become cold, chills come on, and gradually
the powers of the system seem to fail till complete exhaustion
ensues. When gangrene or mortification ensues, the termination is
nearly the same, but more rapid, and all the above symptoms are more
marked. When it passes into the chronic form, there is but little
permanent abatement in the severity of the symptoms for some time;
they partially lessen at intervals, but return again, sometimes with
renewed vigor, and it remains long a matter of doubt whether the
disease has really passed the critical period or not. Recovery takes
place occasionally in this form of the disease, but more frequently
the patient becomes daily weaker and more emaciated, diarrhœa and
slow fever set in, the vital powers steadily sink, and at last death
ensues. This fatal termination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425"
id="Page_425">[425]</a></span> may however be delayed for an indefinite
period, and may ultimately result from Consumption or Dropsy, both of
which frequently follow chronic puerperal fever.</p>

<p>In regard to the probable termination of this disease, but little
hope can be entertained that it will be favorable. Nor are there many
indications that can be relied upon with certainty, as to what course
it is likely to take. In general it is favorable when the swelling
subsides, and the pains abate in severity, and particularly if the milk
and lochia begin to be secreted again. The indications are also good
in proportion as the symptoms are mild, and when there is no great
sympathetic disturbance of other parts of the system. It is regarded as
unfavorable when the pain and tenderness extends over a large portion
of the abdomen, and when the attack commences very suddenly. The danger
is also considered greater in proportion as the disease begins nearer
to delivery; and when its first symptoms exhibit themselves before
labor it is always considered mortal. It is likewise more dangerous
with twins than with a single birth, and with first children than
afterwards. It is seldom possible however to come to any probable
conclusion till between the fifth and tenth day, and even then it is in
general a matter of great uncertainty.</p>

<p>The best treatment of this fearful disease is one of the greatest
problems in medical science. So many different plans have been
adopted, and with such various success, that the history of past
cases affords but little reliable data to guide us in future ones.
In general the most powerful <em>antiphlogistic</em> measures, or
those thought most likely to reduce the inflammation at once, are
immediately resorted to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426"
id="Page_426">[426]</a></span> such as bleeding, purgatives, and cold
bathing. Bleeding is in particular the great agent depended upon,
either from the arm, or by cups and leeches to the abdomen and vulva.
Dr. Gordon, of Aberdeen in Scotland, who once met with a regular
epidemic of puerperal fever in that city, assures us that nothing
else succeeded in arresting the disorder but copious and frequent
bleeding, at the very commencement. He carried it so far as to take
<em>twenty-four ounces</em> at once, and he says that when he did so
the patient was nearly sure to recover, but that at first, when he only
abstracted about twelve ounces, she was as nearly sure to die. In about
fifty cases to which he was called in time, he only lost <em>five</em>,
and taking the average of all he attended the recoveries were about
two-thirds of the whole number, which is above the usual proportion.</p>

<p>It appears however, from the experience of the most eminent
practitioners, that the bleeding must commence early; that the first
abstraction should not be omitted beyond twenty-four hours after
the first symptoms of the disease, and should be as much earlier as
possible. With very few exceptions they also think Gordon's standard
of twenty-four ounces not too much. Indeed it is generally admitted
that if the blood be not drawn <em>at first</em> and in <em>large
portions</em>, it had better not be drawn at all. There may be of
course many peculiar circumstances that will make bleeding improper,
which nothing but experience and observation will teach a practitioner,
but the number of such cases is thought to be small. The use of
leeches meets with but few advocates, and certainly they seem to
have had but partial success, compared with the lancet. Dr. Collins
of Dublin depended chiefly upon leeches and Calomel, but he<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span> tells
us that in <em>eighty-eight</em> cases <em>fifty-six</em> died when so
treated, while in <em>fifteen</em> that were freely bled from the arm
only <em>eight</em> died. In short it appears that the bleeding must be
carried far enough, <em>at the very beginning of the disease</em>, to
cut it short at once, or it will be of no avail, it being of little or
no use merely to <em>check</em> it! In conjunction with the bleeding
it is also usual to give enemas of starch and castor oil, or something
similar, and to bathe the extremities in hot water.</p>

<p>I know that this practice of bleeding meets with strong opposition
from many physicians, and that it is objected to by patients generally.
I myself am as much opposed to it as any one reasonably can be, and
I am well aware of the numerous evils which follow it, but still it
cannot be denied that Dr. Gordon's plan has cured a greater number
of cases of <em>puerperal fever</em> than any other yet tried. It
is true that many of those thus cured may have afterwards died of
dropsy, convulsions, typhus and other diseases <em>produced by the
bleeding</em>, but then the risk they run of dying from these was less
than that from the puerperal fever, and in a choice of evils we ought
to choose the least. It should also be remembered that some eminent
practitioners assert, if this plan be adopted <em>promptly</em> and
<em>fully</em>, it will <em>always cure</em>, or at least with very few
exceptions.</p>

<p>Several other modes of treatment have also been adopted to
dispense with bleeding, some of which have been much more successful
than others, though none so much so as we could desire. Thus some
practitioners resort immediately to hot fomentations and sweating
medicines, or a hot bath if convenient, together with brisk
purgatives, and injections. Some depend upon Calomel in large
doses, with leeches to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428"
id="Page_428">[428]</a></span> the groins and vulva. Others again use
cold fomentations, and cold injections both to the rectum and to the
vagina. Others again use blisters over the abdomen, in conjunction
with purgative enemas and moderate bleeding; but this mode seems to do
but little good. Another plan is to give about six grains of ipecac,
and to repeat the dose several times, at intervals of an hour or less,
in conjunction with purgatives and warm fomentations. Turpentine has
also been used internally and by enema, but seems to have accomplished
little good. Perhaps the most frequent plan after bleeding, is to rub
one or two drachms of <em>Mercurial Ointment</em> well on the skin,
over the abdomen, every two or three hours, sometimes for several days
regularly; eight or ten grains of Calomel being also given daily,
at the same time. This brings on salivation, and in many cases the
symptoms begin to abate in severity as soon as that commences. I am
not aware however, that this treatment is any more successful than
bleeding, nor do I think the consequences afterwards, in a case of
recovery, are any less to be dreaded. It is difficult in fact to say
what plan can be best recommended, even in the majority of cases, and
certainly no one yet tried is applicable to all, on account of the
peculiarities and varying circumstances of each. If the practitioner
or patient is not decidedly opposed to the bleeding plan, that has
undoubtedly the best recommendation, from former success. Next to that
perhaps comes the mercurial treatment, which usually meets with as much
opposition as the bleeding, but which certainly has been frequently
found efficacious. The other plans have met with but little favor,
though possibly they might sometimes succeed when the rest fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429"
id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>If I were asked what I should advise for those who <em>would
not</em> submit to the use either of the lancet or mercury, I should
say, commence with a strong dose of Epsom Salts, or Jalap, and repeat
it in about five hours after its full operation. Also apply warm
fomentations to the abdomen, or put upon it a flannel bag full of hops
soaked in vinegar, as hot as it can be borne, and put mustard poultices
on the feet, and inside of the thighs. The hands must also be kept as
warm as possible, and the head cool. The diet should be very spare,
and contain nothing heating or stimulating, and cooling drinks, such
as ice water, or cold lemonade, should be drunk freely. The purgative
should be repeated at least every day, for two or three days, or more
if the symptoms are not modified, and the mustard poultices may be
regularly used to various parts of the limbs, for the same length of
time. In conjunction with these means the breasts should also be kept
warm, to promote the flow of the milk, and injections of starch and
castor oil should be thrown up the rectum daily. The object being, as
far as possible, to keep the surface of the body warm, and to cool
the internal fever, at the same time that all the natural secretions
are excited as much as possible to remove any morbid matter that
may be formed. It should also be mentioned that the urine sometimes
stops, or at least becomes very scanty and thick, in which case a
little sweet nitre may be given, or if necessary the catheter must be
used. Some bitter tea, as boneset or chammomile, should also be taken
occasionally, and a James's Fever Powder with it once or twice a day,
to promote perspiration; or if there be severe pains, a dose of Dover's
Powders may be used instead.</p>

<p>If the disease passes the acute stage and becomes<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
chronic, the same means must be pursued, and with strict regularity,
or there will be danger of its again becoming acute. In all cases send
for the most experienced practitioner <em>as early as possible</em>,
and whatever his plan may be, if his past success proves it to be
tolerably successful, <em>submit to it</em>, whether it be bleeding,
salivation, or anything else. If there be no one at hand on whom
dependence can be placed, follow the plan I have laid down as nearly as
circumstances will allow, but practise it fully without delay, and till
a change takes place. Those persons who make light of this disease, and
pretend to say that this or that simple treatment is all-sufficient,
either deceive themselves or wish to impose upon others. There are few
affections more serious, as will be evident when it is borne in mind
that, on an average, <em>two females die out of every three attacked by
it</em>. To avoid all liability to it as far as possible, attend well
to the general health during pregnancy, have everything comfortable,
clean, and wholesome, during labor, and be careful to avoid cold,
damp, and all kinds of mental and bodily excitement afterwards. The
assistant also, whoever it may be, must be as careful and as gentle
as possible, so as to avoid all violence or undue force, and <em>not
to hurry nature</em>. A want of attention to such simple details has,
undoubtedly, brought on many attacks of this fearful disease that
otherwise would never have been experienced.</p>


<h5>AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST OCCURRING AFTER PREGNANCY.</h5>

<p>The functions of the breasts are liable, from many causes, to become
deranged, and such derangements may lead to serious results, both to
the mother and the child. It is a common opinion that females who<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
nurse are not so liable to suffer in this way as those who do not, but
experience proves this opinion to be untrue; nevertheless, as it is the
duty of mothers to nourish their own offspring, it should be a subject
of careful study to relieve them of this liability as far as possible,
or to assist them when necessary.</p>

<p><em>Galacterrhœa.</em> This means an overflow, or excessive
secretion of the milk, which sometimes takes place, particularly
in those who do not nurse. At the commencement of the milk fever,
Galacterrhœa needs but little attention, but if it continue to the
second or third day, proper remedies should be applied to correct it.
These consist in complete rest, both of body and mind, cooling drinks,
and spare diet. If these do not correct it soon, a flaxseed poultice
should be placed on each breast, and the patient should be made to
perspire, either by warm teas and clothing, or by means of steaming.
The bowels should also be freely opened with castor oil, or a seidlitz
powder, and it will often benefit very much to give warm water freely
to drink, with ten grains of nitrate of potash (<em>saltpetre</em>) to
the pint.</p>

<p>In those that nurse it is very seldom the case that the secretion
of milk is too profuse, unless the child has been kept too long from
the breast. As a general rule it should be put to nurse in a few
hours after birth, even if there be no milk, because its suction will
materially help to bring on the flow. It frequently happens, when the
child is kept away till the milk comes, that the breasts have swelled
so that the nipple is buried and cannot be laid hold of well by the
mouth, in consequence of which the child does not get nourishment
enough, and the breasts not being well emptied become engorged,
and their functions deranged. All this may be avoided by<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
putting it too early. Sometimes however notwithstanding every
precaution, the flow of milk is excessively great, and constitutes a
real disease, which may cause great weakness and debility. In such
cases it will generally be found that the diet is too stimulating or
too rich, or that the bowels have been too inactive, and the first step
towards an improvement must consist in correcting these faults. The
skin should also be kept active by frequent bathing and good friction,
and the quantity of nourishment taken should not be greater than the
mere healthy support of the body requires. In particular no stimulating
liquors should be used.</p>

<p><i>Agalaxy.</i>&mdash;This complaint is the reverse of the former, as
it consists in a deficient secretion of milk. The causes of this
deficiency are various; sometimes it arises from a constitutional
inertness of the breasts, sometimes from insufficient nourishment, and
sometimes from profuse discharges in other parts. All excesses also
tend to decrease the quantity of the milk, <em>particularly those of
a certain kind</em>; and it is seldom so abundant or lasting either
in extreme youth or advanced age. The appearance of the menses in
like manner generally causes the flow to become less, and it ceases
naturally in some much earlier than in others. Sometimes there is a
deformity in the child's mouth, which prevents its sucking properly,
and the milk may stop for want of being completely drawn. The breasts
also may be diseased, or the nipple not sufficiently prominent, and the
same difficulty be thus produced in another way.</p>

<p>In treating agalaxy, therefore, the first thing is to ascertain
if there be no deformity or disease in either mother or child,
which prevents proper nursing. If there be nothing of the kind, it
must next be ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433"
id="Page_433">[433]</a></span> whether the mother has any excessive
secretion elsewhere, such as diarrhœa, great flow of urine, or heavy
sweats; if she have, these must be corrected. It must next be seen
if she takes sufficient nourishment, and of a proper kind for her
stomach and bowels. Sometimes a little spiced wine is excellent, or
some porter, with white meats, and arrow-root milk. If she be of a
full habit, however, and makes much blood, the contrary course must be
pursued, and the diet be made low and unstimulating, while the bowels
are kept free and the skin in good action.</p>

<p>In many cases when the nipple is small, it may be much enlarged
by titillation, just before the child is put to it, after which the
suction will increase it still more.</p>

<p>If the female be advanced in life, or very weak, or if she becomes
pregnant, it may be better to procure a nurse than to attempt to
stimulate the flow at all. The appearance of the menses need not
occasion a suspension of nursing, unless it evidently deranges the
secretion of the milk, or affects the health of the mother; in either
of which cases the child should be weaned at once.</p>

<p><i>Engorgement of the Breasts.</i>&mdash;The breasts are liable to
become swollen, or engorged, from colds, blows, hard nursing from the
child, over feeding, and from soreness or excoriations preventing them
being fully emptied. This state may occur at any time, but is most
frequent a few days after delivery. In general there is no danger
from it, unless it be very bad or continues too long; it may then
inflame and discharge, or become permanently hardened. To prevent such
accidents the breasts should always be sufficiently emptied, either by
the child or by artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434"
id="Page_434">[434]</a></span> means, and every precaution should
be used against cold or violence. Constipation must also be guarded
against, and the diet and drink must be carefully observed, so that it
be not too feeding, or too stimulating. Warm fomentations or poultices
may also be used when the breasts are painful, and a Dover's Powder may
be given at night, after bathing the feet in warm water, to promote
perspiration.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the Breasts.</i>&mdash;This is only a more advanced
stage of the previous malady, produced by the same causes, and by want
of timely attention. Like simple swelling, it may arise at any time
during nursing, but is more frequent a few days after delivery. As
soon as the inflammation commences the breasts become red, swollen,
and excessively tender, particularly at one point, which soon begins
to project like a nipple, if the disease is not stopped, and at last
bursts and discharges the contained pus. Sometimes the inflammation
is comparatively superficial, and extends only over a small portion
of the surface, but at other times it goes deep and spreads wide. In
proportion to its extent is the severity of the symptoms, which are
those of inflammation in general, such as headache, thirst, fever,
general uneasiness, and cutting pains in the part affected.</p>

<p>As soon as the abscess is formed and can be plainly discovered, it
is usual to open it immediately, because the longer it remains the more
extensive it becomes, and the larger portion of the breast becomes
diseased. It is necessary however to be <em>certain</em>, before making
an opening, that it is really an abscess on which we are going to
operate, for sometimes a healthy part of the breast feels very much
like one, and a mistake may easily be made; in fact such a mistake has
often been made, and by men of experience<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span> too. In the early
stage of the inflammation every effort should be used to prevent an
abscess from forming, by the use of purgatives, sweating medicines,
low diet, cooling drinks, and warm fomentations over the whole chest.
Some females practice <em>cold</em> fomentations over the breasts, and
with good success, in the commencement of the inflammation, but it may
increase the difficulty with others, and, so far as I have seen, is no
more generally useful than the other method. The warm bath all over the
body is also very serviceable in a number of cases.</p>

<p>It usually happens however, in spite of every precaution, that
matter will form, and its discharge become necessary. As soon as
this is evident, it should be promoted as much as possible, by
hot fomentations and poultices, till the head of the abscess is
sufficiently distinct for it to be safely opened. While the swelling is
going on the pain is often very severe, and it should be eased as much
as possible, by using laudanum in the fomentations, or by putting on an
opium plaster. After an abscess has opened and discharged, it should
be kept open for some time, by little pledgets of lint, to prevent its
closing up too soon, otherwise a portion of the matter may be shut
in by the wound healing over it, and another abscess will form. Warm
poultices and lotions should also be used afterwards, to promote the
discharge as much as possible, but they should not be used after it has
evidently begun to cease naturally. In short every means pointed out
should be used energetically in the first stage, to <em>prevent</em>
the gathering, but if it takes place in spite of them, then it should
be <em>hastened</em> and <em>discharged</em> as early as possible, to
prevent its extending. After this, when it has evidently all escaped,
the wound may be suffered to heal, and the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span> patient must be enjoined
to be very careful in future, for the same accident will be very liable
to reappear.</p>

<p>Sometimes these abscesses become very extensive, and remain for a
long time. I have known ten or twelve on one breast, and I have known
them to continue open for many months. When this is the case it is much
to be deplored, as it is very likely indeed to destroy the breast,
and may even lead to more serious results. Attention therefore cannot
be bestowed upon them too early or too unremittingly, particularly
if the female be scrofulous, or of a very full habit. Sometimes the
inflammation attacks both breasts, and at other times only one, in
which case every effort should be exerted to prevent its extending
to the other. In many persons the same side is always affected, and
becomes a scape-goat as it were for the other.</p>

<p>When the means used succeed in scattering the swelling, its
dispersion is usually followed by some critical discharge, such as
diarrhœa, or a great flow of urine, or even by profuse perspiration,
which shows how nature operates in removing the diseased matter, and
cautions us not rashly to check such discharges.</p>

<p>It is a very serious matter for the swelling to <em>indurate</em> or
harden, as it sometimes will, without either scattering or dispersing,
as it is then constantly liable to become worse again, besides
destroying the structure of the gland. Every means should therefore
be used to prevent this, by promoting its dispersion or discharge, in
the way already pointed out. It is also very good in these cases to
bathe frequently with alum water, or decoction of white oak bark, or
even to rub on some of the <em>Ointment of Hydriodate of Potassa</em>,
diluted with an equal weight of fresh lard. A piece as large as a
hickory nut may be well rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437"
id="Page_437">[437]</a></span> on twice a day, for three or four days,
but it should be stopped immediately the swelling begins to subside,
and not used again unless it still remains or again increases. In many
cases pretty frequent friction, with the hand anointed with a little
oil, will be all sufficient, especially if a hot fomentation be used
afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Excoriations, or Cracks in the Breasts.</i>&mdash;The annoyance from
this cause is sometimes very great, the pain which is experienced when
the child begins to nurse being so acute that it is impossible for the
mother to allow it to remain. Frequently I have known it compel weaning
much earlier than was desirable, and sometimes it has even been so
bad, that the dress could scarcely be borne against the breasts. The
precise cause of this liability to crack is not known, nor do we know
of any certain means to prevent it. In many cases however I have known
it prevented, to a great extent, by having the nipple gently sucked,
very frequently, for six weeks or two months before childbirth. This
hardens it, and if a wash of borax water be also used, after each time,
it will be gradually prepared for its proper use. Our means of curing
this troublesome affection are very limited, and frequently everything
fails that is tried. The mucilage of Quince seed, prepared by bruising
and boiling them in a small quantity of water, rubbed over the sores
with a soft feather, immediately after nursing, often does much good.
The mucilage from the tender tops of young sassafras sometimes succeeds
better than that from the Quince, and a bruised leaf from the large
<em>horse-shoe Geranium</em>, laid on like a poultice, is sometimes
better than either. A good lotion may also be made with a quarter
of an ounce of borax, and a tea-spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span> of laudanum, to half
a pint of warm water, to be used frequently during the day. Some
females use a wash made of saleratus, with considerable benefit, and
others find relief from one made of nut galls, or white oak bark. Most
of these means however are well known, and many others also, which,
like them, sometimes succeed and often fail. The artificial nipple,
or <em>shield</em>, should be tried if none of these means succeed,
and frequently it will enable the mother to allow the child to nurse,
though it may not altogether prevent the pain.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens that the child's mouth may be diseased,
particularly with <em>apthæ</em>, or thrush, and this may possibly keep
up the excoriations; in like manner the state of the breasts may also
influence the mouth, and therefore the condition of each should be well
ascertained when anything is the matter with either.</p>


<h5>BRONCHOCELE, OR SWELLING IN THE THROAT.</h5>

<p>This is often observed in childbed, and sometimes even comes on
during labor. It is usually attributed to cold, and no doubt it often
does arise from cold, but more frequently it is owing to sympathetic
derangement, and from violent attempts to swallow during and after the
pains. Many females in fact cry out at those times, that something
has <em>broken</em> in the throat, and they fear they are going to
suffocate. As a general rule the swelling gradually subsides in a
short time, without any special treatment, but sometimes it increases
and inflames, and an abscess forms which may become very troublesome,
and even dangerous. To prevent this it should be frequently treated
with warm fomentations and poultices, till the inflammation
subsides, and then with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439"
id="Page_439">[439]</a></span> the same washes recommended for
indurated or hardened breast, in the preceding section of this chapter.
If the swelling becomes hard, and remains indolent, the ointment
of hydriodate of potassa may also be prepared and used, as there
recommended.</p>


<h5>PHLEGMASIA ALBA DOLENS, OR MILK LEG.</h5>

<p>This is a painful tumefaction or swelling of one or both of the
limbs, which comes on from the fifth to the fifteenth day after
delivery. It generally commences with slight pain, or stiffness, or
cramp, becoming more painful as it proceeds; but, sometimes, shooting,
cutting pains, of great violence, are felt suddenly, at the very
commencement. The swelling, also, sometimes comes on gradually, but, at
other times, rapidly. In most cases the patient complains of a sudden
pain in the groin and thigh, which is preceded by a chill followed
by fever, and then the limb begins to enlarge. Most frequently the
lower part swells first, and then it extends upward, sometimes, even
to the hip. The skin, on the swollen part, looks white, shining and
tight, as if ready to break; it is also extremely painful, so that
pressure upon it can scarcely be borne. It looks in fact like a thin
bag of skin filled with milk, and hence the name <em>milk leg</em>,
from an idea that it was really filled with milk, which had, by some
means, reached there from the breast. This idea is erroneous, in the
sense it is usually taken; the milk does not flow into the leg as
many imagine, nor is anything like it to be found there, except a
peculiar thin, white matter, when it breaks. Still, however, a sudden
stoppage of the milk may cause such a swelling, like a sudden stoppage
of any other secretion, but in no other way.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span> It is, probably,
most frequently produced by sudden cold, which checks that profuse
perspiration into which females gradually fall immediately after
delivery, and so drives the perspirable matter within, and causes
inflammation and suppuration. A difficult or prolonged labor may also
lead to it, by preventing, for a long time, the proper circulation of
the blood through the large veins of the pelvis, and so engorging those
below. Or the veins may become paralyzed, as it were, by the pressure
they have sustained, and so become, for a time, unable to transmit the
blood. In fact, both the veins and lymphatics become engorged, as if
tied above the limb, and exhibit knots and bundles, like bunches of
grapes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fever will occur some days first, and the female
cannot tell what it is owing to, till the swelling comes on; and even
this may take place so gradually, and with so little pain, that the
limb may be very large before it is observed. I have known females
complain of a slight fever only, on going to sleep at night, and wake
up in the morning with a confirmed case of milk leg; and I have known
others start with a sudden pain in the groin, or hip, and be affected
in the same way, in less than two hours.</p>

<p>The disease usually lasts from a month to seven or eight weeks,
and terminates, either by a gradual resolution, or scattering, of the
fluids, or by suppuration and discharge. When suppuration ensues, there
will, sometimes, form one or more very large abscesses, which it may be
difficult to heal, and which may lead to serious results, either from
their extent, or from the constitutional irritation they produce.</p>

<p>The treatment, at first, consists in warm fomentations, such as
those of poppy-heads, or hops, with cooling drinks, purgatives, low
unstimulating diet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441"
id="Page_441">[441]</a></span> occasional doses of James's Fever
Powder, to promote perspiration. This is intended to disperse the
swelling, and, in general, it does so. If, however, the abscess forms
and breaks, in spite of all the means used, it must be treated the same
as abscess in the breast, previously described. In ordinary practice,
it is the general custom to <em>bleed</em> at the commencement of the
disease, or to apply leeches to the groin. This sometimes does good,
but frequently is of no service at all, even if it does not make
matters worse. I would, however, make the same remarks on bleeding
here, as I did in regard to its use in <em>puerperal fever</em>, to
which milk leg has a resemblance, in some respects.</p>

<p>Another practice is to use tight bandages, the same as for varicose
veins, but I think the plan is not, in general, a successful one,
though it may be occasionally. Plunging the limb in cold water,
or keeping it wrapped in cold wet cloths, has succeeded much more
frequently, and is, with some, a favorite remedy. Stramonium leaves
boiled in vinegar, and laid on hot, will also effect a cure sometimes;
and so will bathing with hot lye or alcohol. A large poultice of hops,
soaked in hot vinegar, has also been found useful.</p>


<h5>TROUBLE WITH THE URINE.</h5>

<p>The bladder, from its position, is very apt to be inconveniently
pressed during the passage of the child, and to be temporarily
affected for a short time after, in consequence. Sometimes, the
neck of the bladder will be <em>paralyzed</em>, and the urine
cannot be discharged. In this case, fomentations of warm milk and
laudanum must be used, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442"
id="Page_442">[442]</a></span> warm hip bath, if there be no danger
of flooding, and the bowels must be freely opened. If this does not
relieve, the catheter must be used, and always before the bladder is
too full. To avoid its becoming so, the attendant should inquire of
the female, during the first day, if she has urinated, or feels any
inclination that way, so that he may know in time if the difficulty
exists. In general, this paralysis passes off in the course of a day,
but may endure longer sometimes; in which case the patient herself
should speak of it. Cases have been known where the bladder has become
so full as to <em>burst</em> through inattention to this matter. The
contrary difficulty is occasionally observed, and the urine cannot
be retained, but it flows away as fast as it is secreted. It is very
seldom, however, that this state remains more than a single day and,
more frequently only a few hours. A dash of cold water on the pubes,
and against the meatus urinarius, has often corrected it at once,
and so has a single purgative dose. If it remain after the first two
days without amendment, it is customary to put a small blister on the
abdomen, which usually relieves in a short time.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><small>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE UTILITY AND
PROPRIETY OF PREVENTING THE PAIN AND SUFFERING WHICH USUALLY ATTENDS
CHILDBIRTH, WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED FOR THAT
PURPOSE.</small></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preface to this work I remarked
that a great part, and, perhaps, nearly the whole, of the suffering and
danger to which parturient females are exposed, arises, undoubtedly,
from their bad physical education and mode of life; and that, in a
more rational state of existence, it was probable that both would
be so slight as to excite no apprehension. This improved state of
things is much to be desired, and should, of course, be striven for
by all friends of humanity. But, in the mean time, it is proper to
consider whether there are any means by which those now living can
be relieved in their hours of distress. The agony which many females
endure at this time is so great that there are few circumstances
under which relief is more needed, or would be more acceptable; and
I, for one, cannot subscribe to the doctrine that such relief would
be improper, unless it prove to be injurious. There are some persons,
I know, who say that this suffering has been <em>ordained</em> for
woman, and that it <em>ought to be</em> endured. This notion, I
think, needs no refutation, it being just as unreasonable as to say
that the sick should be allowed to suffer and die without assistance,
because <em>their</em> condition has been ordained. There are others,
and men of science, too, who think that the pains of childbirth are
necessary to its safe accomplishment, and that they are also valuable
in a <em>moral</em> point of view. This opinion will be examined by
and by, and the facts on which it is founded, carefully analyzed; but
it is first necessary to state the means of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span> prevention usually
employed, and to note their mode of action, and effects.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a celebrated physiologist, who supposed that
the chief cause of pain and difficulty in labor was the size and
hardness of the child's <em>bones</em>, advanced the theory that if
these bones were less developed, and softer, the pain and difficulty
would be materially lessened, if not entirely removed. He proposed,
therefore, since the hardness of the bones is caused by the deposition
of <em>lime</em> in them, which is derived, of course, from the blood
of the mother, that she should avoid taking anything to eat or drink,
during pregnancy, that contained lime. This, he supposed, would keep
the bones of the child soft till after birth, and so allow them to give
way and crush together during delivery, and thus prevent the suffering
and difficulty usually experienced. It was also thought that the bones
of the mother would be partially softened at the same time, and give
way a little, so as to facilitate the process still more.</p>

<p>I am not aware, however, that this theory has ever succeeded in
practice, either in the human species or in the lower animals, though
frequently tried. Nature will work on her own plan, and will develop
the bones of the fœtus, while in the womb, to a certain extent,
providing she has the means to do so; and if these are withheld, she
is very likely to suspend its development altogether, rather than send
it forth imperfect. I have known cases where everything was withheld,
for the whole period, that contained a particle of lime, and yet the
child's bones were as hard at birth as in any other case; the material
being, probably, taken from the bones of the mother, which might be
thus weakened, and made liable to displacement, without any good result
whatever. It is also a question whether such a course, supposing it
to succeed, might not be dangerous in another way, by causing an
imperfection in the child which its future growth could not overcome.
I have known some cases where this practice appeared to have caused
abortion from imperfect development, and several others in which
there was too much reason to fear that the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span> child was injured,
though safely born. As this is, therefore, at best, a very uncertain
and ineffective process, and is also, probably, dangerous to the
mother or child, or both, it does not appear to me worthy of further
attention, and I merely allude to it in order to make the present
sketch of such means complete.</p>

<p>The other means are such as do not interfere, in any way, with the
natural processes, but merely prevent sensation or feeling at the time
of delivery. <em>Mesmerism</em> has been recommended, and, in some
few instances, tried, for this purpose, but its success has either
been so small, or its action so uncertain, that no dependance can be
placed upon it, notwithstanding many persons assert its power. Opium
and other powerful drugs have also been given, but so much of them is
required, at that time, to produce a sufficient effect, that their use
becomes dangerous. Other substances, in the form of <em>vapour</em>, or
<em>gas</em>, have also been used, the effects of which only last for
a short time, and are not, generally speaking, at all dangerous. Among
them may be mentioned nitrous oxide, or <em>laughing gas</em>, carbonic
acid, sulphuric ether, and chloric ether, all of which were first
employed in severe surgical operations.</p>

<p>The success of these agents, especially <em>ether</em> and
<em>chloroform</em>, in <em>preventing pain</em>, is undoubted; nor
do they appear to have any other effect, nor to prevent any necessary
effort or process of nature, except in a few cases which will be
mentioned further on. Many hundred operations of the most severe kind,
such as cutting off limbs, removing tumors, stones, and so forth,
have been performed while the patients were under the influence of
these agents, and without causing them <em>the slightest pain</em>;
in fact, many remain, during the whole process, in a pleasant dream,
and cannot be persuaded, when they wake, that the dreaded operation
is over. The same thing has also been observed in hundreds of cases
of midwifery, both in natural labor and when instruments have been
used. In numerous instances the female has been <em>put to sleep</em>,
and safely delivered, without knowing or feeling anything whatever,
during the whole time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447"
id="Page_447">[447]</a></span> the first intimation that she had
become a mother, being the cheering cry of her newborn babe. In some
instances, the state of insensibility has been continued for a long
time, and during its continuance, the most hazardous operations have
been safely performed.</p>

<p>So far as can be safely judged, from the limited time during which
such means have been used, it appears that there is no danger whatever,
from their employment, except when improperly administered, and in
certain peculiar conditions of the system; which causes of danger
will, of course, be removed by competent experience and knowledge. It
is highly encouraging however, to note, though ether and chloroform
have both been used so extensively and indiscriminately, both by those
who understood their nature and those who did not, that the cases in
which they are proved to have done injury, are <em>not more than two
or three</em>; and in all those that I have heard of, some obvious
impropriety had been committed in their use. It should be borne in
mind, however, that even if the danger from them was considerable,
we might still be justified in their use. It is well known that, in
numerous cases, the <em>fear</em> of suffering, beforehand, and its
severity while being endured, produce the most serious, and even
fatal results. Many a patient has passed safely through the ordinary
effects of a painful operation, and yet sunk from the mere effects of
<em>fear</em> and physical suffering. Instances have even been known
in which a fear of this kind has caused <em>death</em>, and frequently
it has given a shock from which the patient never fully recovered.
There is also, frequently, great danger from the violent efforts and
struggles of a person in pain, and many necessary operations are even
prevented altogether by them; this is often observed in difficult
labors. When insensibility is produced, however, all these causes of
difficulty and danger are removed; the patient's <em>fears</em> are
quieted, suffering is entirely prevented, and there is no struggling
to prevent the necessary assistance. Supposing, therefore, that the
ill effects of these agents were more certain and greater in amount
than has yet appeared, it would still be a question whether<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span> the
evil they really prevent is not greater than that which they possibly
<em>may</em> cause.</p>

<p>In regard to the two agents now chiefly used, <em>ether and
chloroform</em>, there is no difference in their mode of action, but
the chloroform appears to be more speedy, certain, and efficacious, and
is, therefore, the most valuable, but proportionably more dangerous
when improperly administered. There are numerous instruments or
<em>inhalers</em>, for administering these vapors, most of which
are both costly and complicated, and all of which may be easily
dispensed with. A very good plan is to take a large sponge and dip
it in hot water, then squeeze out the water and pour on the ether
or chloroform, and hold it over the mouth and nose. In two or three
minutes consciousness and feeling will both be gone, and the patient
will sink into a calm sleep which will last sometimes ten or fifteen
minutes, and may be kept up as long as desired, by putting the sponge
to the mouth for a few minutes whenever there are signs of waking.
When it is left off the patient gradually comes round as if waking
from ordinary sleep, and frequently speaks of having been in a dream,
sometimes of a very pleasant character, but never knows what has
taken place. No ill effects follow, but sometimes there is a little
drowsiness or stiffness of the limbs, which soon passes off. A pocket
handkerchief soaked in the fluid, and held over the mouth and nose will
answer equally well; but whatever is used, <em>it must not be pressed
close</em>, because a portion of air ought to enter with the vapor to
prevent suffocation; and it should also be removed immediately the
effect is produced. When it is borne in mind how much these requisites
have been neglected, and how <em>impure</em> the ether or chloroform
has often been, it is wonderful that more accidents have not occurred;
and the fact that so few have happened under such a state of things,
and with our little experience, goes far to prove that there is
little or no danger at all in competent hands, with pure materials.
The accounts circulated in the papers of "<em>death from ether</em>,"
and "<em>fatal effects of chloroform</em>," have mostly been gross
exaggerations, and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449"
id="Page_449">[449]</a></span> false altogether. In most of the cases
where death has <em>followed</em> from the use of these agents, it
has been proved to arise from other causes, and would have happened
if they had not been used. In one or two cases, however, of surgical
operations, the ether itself appears to have caused death by producing
suffocation, or congestion of the lungs; but, even in these, it has
been shown that it was used in an improper manner. Thus a young woman
in Newcastle in England, inhaled ether to have a diseased toe-nail
cut off, and died. It appears, however, that there was an evident
disposition in her to congestion or rushes of blood, and therefore
she was not a fit subject, and besides, the ether was poured on a
<em>thick table cloth</em>, which, of course, prevented the entrance
of <em>air</em> along with the vapor, and thus suffocated. I believe
there is <em>not a single case</em> on record of injury resulting when
due precautions have been used, and I have not heard of one at all in
midwifery practice.</p>

<p><em>Ether</em> having been the first article used, I shall first
give an account of its effects, and then proceed to chloroform,
explaining the mode of administration, and other incidental matters, as
I proceed. The best article on ether which I have met with, is a review
in the British and Foreign Medical Review for April, 1847, of some
pamphlets on the subject, from which I shall make an extract.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the state of perfect etherization we believe all sensation is
abolished; in a less perfect state an obscure perception of external
objects remains, while the sense of pain is extinct. The psychical
state is various. Generally speaking, the sense of external impressions
becomes at first confused, then dull, then false, with optical spectra
or auditory illusions, general mental confusion, and then a state
of dreaming or utter oblivion. In the majority of cases the mind is
busy in dreaming, the dreams being generally of an active kind, often
agreeable, sometimes the reverse, occasionally most singular; and,
frequently, a great deal is transacted in the few short moments of
this singular trance. Many of the patients who have undergone the
most dreadful operations, such as amputation of one or both thighs
or arms, extraction of the stone, excision<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span> of bones, extirpation
of the mamma, have readily detailed to us, and most with wondering
thankfulness, the dreams with which, and with which alone, they were
occupied during the operations. The character of the dreams seemed
to be influenced, as in ordinary cases, by various causes, immediate
or remote, present or past, relating to events or flowing from
temperament.</p>

<p>A good many seemed to fancy themselves on the railway amid its
whirl and noise and smoke; some young men were hunting, others riding
on coaches; the boys were happy at their sports in the open fields,
or the filthy lane; the worn Londoner was in his old haunts carousing
with his fellows; and our merry friend, Paddy, of the London Hospital,
was again at his fair, wielding his shelala in defence of his friends.
Others, of milder mood, and especially some of the women patients from
the country, felt themselves suddenly transported from the great city
and the crowded hospital-ward to their old quiet home in the distant
village, happy once more with their mothers and brothers and sisters.
As with the dying gladiator of the poet, the thoughts of these poor
people&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Were with the heart, and that was far away."</p>

<p class="noindent">Some seemed transported to a less definite but
still happy region, which they vaguely indicated by saying they were in
heaven; while others had still odder and warmer visions, which need not
be particularized.</p>

<p>For the purpose of obtaining information on all the points of this
most interesting subject, we personally questioned all the patients in
the London hospitals, who, at the period of our visits, still remained
in the wards after the ether-operations. They were in all fifty-four,
and the great majority had been the subjects of capital operations.
They were unanimous in their expressions of delight and gratitude
at having been relieved from their diseases without suffering. In
listening to their reports, it was not always easy to remain unmoved
under the influence of the conceptions thereby communicated, of the
astonishing contrast between the actual physical condition of the
mangled body in its apparent tortures on the operating table of a
crowded theatre, and the really happy mental state of the patient at
the time.</p>

</div>

<p>This perfect freedom from pain is proved by every case wherein the
vapor has been efficiently administered,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span> although there are
frequently the same cries uttered, and the same motions practised as
when pain is experienced which proves that nothing is prevented but the
mere <em>feeling</em>, which it can be of no use whatever for any one
to suffer from.</p>

<p><em>Chloroform</em> has been more recently introduced than ether,
but has nevertheless been used quite as much, or probably more, and, in
general, with still more success. It was first described, I believe, by
Professor Simpson of Edinburgh, at a sitting of the medical society of
that city, in November, 1847, and several cases were narrated, two of
which I quote.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have employed it in obstetric practice with entire success. The
lady to whom it was first exhibited during parturition, had been
previously delivered in the country by perforation of the head of the
infant, after a labor of three days' duration. In this, her second
confinement, pains supervened a fortnight before the full time.
Three hours and a half after they commenced, ere the dilatation of
the os uteri was completed, I placed her under the influence of the
chloroform, by moistening with half a teaspoonful of the liquid, a
pocket-handkerchief, rolled up in a funnel shape, and with the broad
or open end of the funnel placed over her mouth and nostrils. In
consequence of the operation of the fluid it was once more renewed in
about ten or twelve minutes. The child was expelled in twenty-five
minutes after the inhalation was begun. The mother subsequently
remained longer soporose than commonly happens after ether. The
crying of the child did not, as usual, rouse her; and some minutes
elapsed after the placenta was expelled, and after the child was
removed by the nurse into another room, before the patient awoke. She
then turned round and observed to me that she had "enjoyed a very
comfortable sleep, and, indeed, required it as she was so tired, but
would now be more able for the work before her." I evaded entering
into conversation with her, believing, as I have already stated, that
the most complete possible quietude forms one of the principal secrets
for the successful employment of either ether or chloroform. In a
little time, she again remarked, that she was afraid her "sleep had
stopped the pains." Shortly afterwards her infant was brought in by the
nurse from the adjoining room, and it was a matter of no small<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
difficulty to convince the astonished mother that the labor was
entirely over, and that the child presented to her was really her "own
living baby."</p>

<p>Perhaps I may be excused for adding, that since publishing on the
subject of ether inhalation in midwifery, seven or eight months ago,
and then for the first time directing the attention of the profession
to its great use and importance in natural and morbid parturition, I
have employed it, with few and rare exceptions, in every case of labor
that I have attended, and with the most delightful results. And I have
no doubt whatever, that some years hence the practice will be general.
Obstetricians may oppose it, but I believe our patients themselves will
force the use of it upon the profession. I have never had the pleasure
of watching over a series of better and more rapid recoveries, nor once
witnessed any disagreeable result follow to either mother or child,
whilst I have often seen an immense amount of maternal pain and agony
saved by its employment. And I most conscientiously believe that the
proud mission of the physician is distinctly twofold&mdash;namely, to
alleviate human suffering, as well as preserve human life.</p>

</div>

<p>In another part of the same publication Professor Simpson has
another list of cases, all equally favorable. In some of these the
labors were protracted <em>many hours</em>, and in others, operations
with instruments were performed, of the most terrible character, such
as would, under ordinary circumstances, have been attended with the
most horrible suffering. As this article gives an instance of nearly
every kind of delivery under the influence of chloroform, and contains
also some admirable reflections upon its employment, I quote it in
order to make the present account complete.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Case 2.</span>&mdash;Seen with Mr. Carmichael; a
second labor; she began the chloroform inhalation before the dilatation
of the os uteri was entirely completed; the child was expelled in
fifty minutes afterwards. I kept her under the chloroform for a
quarter of an hour, till the placenta was removed, the binder applied,
and the body and bed-clothes were arranged and adjusted. On awaking
she declared that she had been sleeping refreshingly; she was quite
unaware that the child was born, till she suddenly heard it crying
at its first toilet in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453"
id="Page_453">[453]</a></span> next room. An hour afterwards she
declared she felt perfectly unfatigued, and not as if she had borne a
child at all. In her first or preceding confinement she had been in
severe labor for twenty hours, followed by flooding. No hæmorrhage on
the present occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 3.</span>&mdash;Patient unmarried; a first
labor; twins; the first child presented by the pelvis, the second with
the hand and head. The chloroform was exhibited when the os uteri was
nearly fully dilated; the passages speedily became greatly relaxed,
(as has happened in other cases placed under its full influence,) and
in a few pains the first child was born, assisted by traction. I broke
the membranes of the second, pushed up the hand, and secured the more
complete presentation of the head; three pains expelled the child. The
mother was then bound up, her clothes were changed, and she was lifted
into another bed; during all this time she slept soundly on, and for a
full hour afterwards, the chloroform acting in this as in other cases
of its prolonged employment, as a soporific. The patient recollected
nothing from the time of the first inhalations, and was greatly
distressed when not one but two living children were brought in by the
nurse to her. Dr. Christison, who was anxious to observe the effect of
the chloroform upon the uterus, went along with me to this patient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 4.</span>&mdash;Primipara; of full habit;
when the first examination was made, the passages were rigid, and the
os uteri difficult to reach. Between six and seven hours after labor
began, the patient, who was complaining much, was apathized with the
chloroform. In about two hours afterwards, the os uteri was fully
dilated, and in four hours and a half after the inhalation was begun,
a large child was expelled. The placenta was removed, and the patient
bound up and dressed before she was allowed to awake. This patient
required an unusual quantity of chloroform, and Dr. Williamson, who
remained beside her, states to me, in his notes of the case, "the
handkerchief was moistened often, in order to keep up the soporific
effect. On one occasion I allowed her to emerge from this state for a
short time, but on the accession of the first pain, she called out so
loudly for the chloroform that it was necessary to pacify her by giving
her some immediately. In all, four ounces of chloroform were used."
Like the others, she was quite unconscious of what had gone on during
her soporised state, and awoke altogether unaware that her child was
born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454"
id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 6.</span>&mdash;Second labor.
The patient&mdash;a person of a small form and delicate
constitution&mdash;bore her first child prematurely at the seventh
month. After being six hours in labor, the os uteri was fully expanded,
and the head well down in the pelvic cavity. For two hours subsequently
it remained fixed in nearly the same position, and scarcely, if at all,
advanced, although the pains were very distressing, and the patient
becoming faint and exhausted. She entertained some mistaken religious
feelings against ether or chloroform, which had made her object to the
earlier use of the latter; but I now placed her under its influence.
She lay, as usual, like a person soundly asleep under it, and I was
now able, without any suffering on her part, to increase the intensity
and force of each recurring pain, by exciting the uterus and abdominal
muscles through pressure on the lower part of the vagina and perinæum.
The child was expelled in about fifteen minutes after the inhalation
was commenced. In a few minutes she awoke to ask if it was really
possible that her child had been born, and was overjoyed to be told
that it was so. I have the conviction, that in this case the forceps
would in all probability have been ultimately required, provided I had
not been able to have interfered in the way mentioned. I might, it is
true, have followed the same proceeding, though the patient was not in
an anæsthetic state; but I could not have done so without inflicting
great agony upon her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 7.</span>&mdash;A third labor; the patient
had been twice before confined of dead premature children; once of
twins, under the care of Mr. Stone, of London; the second time of a
single child under my charge. The liquor amnii began to escape about
one o'clock, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but without pains
for some time. I saw her between three and four o'clock, with the
pains commencing and the os uteri beginning to dilate. In two hours
afterwards, the third stage was well advanced, and the pains becoming
very severe, she had the chloroform exhibited to her, and slept soundly
under its influence. In twenty minutes the child was born and cried
very loudly without rousing the mother. In about twelve or fifteen
minutes more she awoke as the application of the binder was going on,
and immediately demanded if her child was really born alive, as she
thought she had some recollection of hearing the nurse say so. She was
rejoiced beyond measure on her son being brought in and presented to
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 9.</span>&mdash;In the Maternity
Hospital; first child. Labor<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span> began at 10 <span
class="smcap">P.M.</span>, (Nov. 21st.) I was desired to see her at six
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, (22nd.) The os uteri was well dilated,
but it was evident that the pelvic canal was contracted throughout,
and the head was passing with unusual difficulty through the brim. The
patient was complaining much of her sufferings. It was evident that it
would be a very tedious, and probably, at last, an instrumental case,
and one therefore calculated to test the length of time during which
chloroform might be used. She began to inhale it at a quarter past
six, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and was kept under its influence
till a quarter past seven, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,&mdash;the
date of her delivery&mdash;<em>thirteen hours</em> in all. From the
time it was begun till the time delivery was completed, her cries
and complaints ceased, and she slept on soundly throughout the day.
The bladder required to be emptied several times with the catheter.
The head passed the os uteri at ten <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
and during the day, gradually descended through the pelvis. At seven
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, I at last deemed it proper to deliver
her by the forceps; the head, which was now elongated and œdematous,
having by that time rested for some hours against the contracted pelvic
outlet, with little or no evidence of advancement; the bones of the
fœtal cranium overlapping each other, and the fœtal heart becoming less
strong and distinct in its pulsations. A warm bath, irritation of the
chest, &amp;c., were necessary to excite full and perfect respiration
in the infant. Whilst we were all busied with the infant, the mother
lost some blood, but the placenta was immediately removed, and the
uterus contracted perfectly. On afterwards measuring the quantity of
blood lost, it was calculated to amount to fifteen or eighteen ounces.
The mother's clothes were changed, she was bound up, and removed to a
dry bed before she awoke. She had at first no idea that the child was
born, and was in no respect conscious of being delivered. In fact,
she had been "sleeping," according to her own account, from the time
she had begun the inhalation, and thought she remembered or dreamed
that she heard Dr. Williamson, the house-surgeon, speak near her once
or twice. Dr. Beilby, Dr. Ziegler, &amp;c., saw the case with me.
Three days afterwards I found the mother and child perfectly well.
She continued to recover so rapidly, that she insisted on leaving the
hospital on the tenth day after delivery.</p>

</div>

<p>A sufficient number of such accounts as these could<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span> be
collected to fill a large volume; but these are quite sufficient for
our purpose.</p>

<p>In regard to the objections to using chloroform or ether, in
midwifery, it will be thought by most persons, and with good reason,
too, that the safety and success which has attended their use, is
itself a sufficient answer to all objections.</p>

<p>It was at first thought, by some physicians, that the expulsive
force of the womb was lessened when the pain was prevented; but this
is not the case; on the contrary, it has been, in many cases, much
increased. It was also thought by others that there was more danger
from flooding, and convulsions, than in ordinary cases; but this is
also equally at variance with truth, for it appears, beyond doubt,
after a careful examination of all the cases recorded, that there is
much <em>less</em> danger, particularly from convulsions, than when the
patient is allowed to be tortured and terrified by feeling pain. Dr.
Simpson remarks in another part of the article above quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question which I have been repeatedly asked is this&mdash;Will
we ever be "justified" in using the vapor of ether to assuage the
pains of natural labor? Now, if experience betimes goes fully to prove
to us the safety with which ether may, under proper precautions and
management, be employed in the course of parturition, then, looking
to the facts of the case, and considering the actual amount of pain
usually endured, I believe that the question will require to be quite
changed in its character. For, instead of determining, in relation
to it, whether we shall be "justified" in using this agent under the
circumstances named, it will become, on the other hand, necessary to
determine whether, on any grounds, moral or medical, a professional man
could deem himself "justified" in withholding and <em>not</em> using
any such safe means, (as we at present presuppose this to be,) provided
he had the power, by it, of assuaging the pains and anguish of the last
stage of natural labor, and thus counteracting what Velpeau describes
as "those piercing cries, that agitation so lively, those excessive
efforts, those inexpressible agonies, and those pains apparently<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
intolerable," which accompany the termination of natural parturition in
the human mother.</p>

<p>Since the latter end of January I have employed etherization with
few and rare exceptions, in every case of labor which has been under my
care. And the results, as I already stated in <span class="smcap">The
Lancet</span>, have been, indeed, most happy and gratifying. I never
had the pleasure of watching over a series of more perfect or more
rapid recoveries; nor have I once witnessed any disagreeable result
to either mother or child. I do not remember a single patient to have
taken it who has not afterwards declared her sincere gratitude for its
employment, and her indubitable determination to have recourse again
to similar means under similar circumstances. Most have subsequently
set out, like zealous missionaries, to persuade other friends to avail
themselves of the same measure in the hour of suffering. And a number
of my most esteemed professional brethren in Edinburgh have adopted
it with success and results equal to my own. At the same time, I most
sincerely believe that we are, all of us, called upon to employ it,
by every principle of true humanity, as well as by every principle of
true religion. Medical men may oppose, for a time, the superinduction
of anæsthesia in parturition, but they will oppose it in vain; for
certainly our patients themselves and their friends will force the
use of it upon the profession. The whole question is, I believe, even
now, one merely of time. It is not&mdash;Shall the practice come to be
generally adopted? but&mdash;When shall it be generally adopted? And,
for my part, I more than doubt if any man (rejecting willingly its
benefits) is really justified, on any grounds, moral or medical, in
deliberately desiring and asking his patients to shriek and writhe in
their agonies for a few months, or a few years longer, in order that,
by doing so, they may defer, forsooth, to his professional apathy, or
pander to his professional caprices and prejudices.</p>

</div>

<p>Another objection has also been advanced against the employment of
ether or chloroform, the force of which must be estimated by every one
for themselves. It is well known that many, if not most of the lower
animals during labor, or immediately afterward, <em>experience certain
feelings and desires stronger than at any other time</em>; and it is
supposed that such would be the case, as<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span> a general rule, with
human beings, if it were not for the <em>pain</em> which overpowers
everything else. This supposition has, in fact, been partly verified
in a few cases; several females having confessed, after recovering
from a painless labor under the influence of ether, that their dreams
during the sleep were of <em>a peculiar warm character!</em> How far
this may be <em>generally</em> the case, of course, we have no means of
ascertaining, nor do I consider it to be practically of any consequence
to know, because it can in no way interfere with the safe progress and
termination of the labor, which alone is what we are properly concerned
in. I have merely thought it proper to state the fact as being a
singular one, and to make my readers acquainted with it. Physicians
are well aware that the peculiar feelings referred to are frequently
produced by various causes which act on the nervous system, such as
<em>mesmerism</em>, and even by <em>strong devotional excitement</em>.
I have known females with strong moral impressions who always carefully
avoided <em>both</em> the above causes, from having discovered their
liability to produce such effects; in fact, this has been one objection
raised to allowing mesmerists to operate upon young persons, and
several cases of moral failing having been attributed to this cause. It
is not at all improbable, therefore, that such results may occasionally
occur during labor, though we are not at all justified in assuming that
they will in any particular case. How far this may be considered an
objection to the employment of such means, must be however, as I before
remarked, decided by all persons <em>for themselves</em>, and <em>for
themselves only!</em> It is not a <em>medical</em> question at all.</p>

<p class="ph2">Notices of Dr. Hollick's Lectures.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick and Physiology.</span>&mdash;The
second of a series of Lectures, by this gentleman, on human physiology,
and the all important truths connected with our physical constitution,
was attended by a full house, in National Hall, last evening. The time
was well spent, and so appeared to think the audience. On the delivery
of the first of these Lectures on Tuesday evening, the speaker in
a comprehensive and well-digested exordium, placed himself and the
subject right with the public. His manner, language and style, did
the first; his sound logic, his argument, his candor and research,
accomplished the second. Apart from the interesting and apposite
details of the wonders of reproduction, the illustrations of the
immutable wisdom of nature, which teem in the animal and vegetable
worlds&mdash;which</p>

<p class="poem hangingindent3">
"Glows in each stem, and blossoms in each tree;<br />
Lives through all life, extends through all extent,<br />
Spreads undivided, operates unspent."<br />
</p>

<p>Apart from all this, Dr. Hollick's Lecture was excellent as a
defence of truth, a vindication of the right of free and unshackled
inquiry, and as a convincing refutation of that silly, but far too
prevalent opinion that there are truths of which it is better to remain
in a state of ignorance. Had nothing else been imparted in the forcible
and well defined exordium of Dr. Hollick than this judicious demolition
of that fallacious, silly, but injurious twaddle which would forbid
research to pass in advance of the old landmarks prescribed by custom,
ignorance, or a spurious morality&mdash;even that would well deserve
the public patronage. Truths, well set forth, will make an impression,
whether their investigation be fashionable or not. There is an affinity
between the capacity to learn, and the truths to be learned, which
always results, when a fitting opportunity is presented, in a free
inquiry, and the gentleman who is bringing, in a judicious and elevated
manner, a knowledge of those fundamental principles of our corporeal
existence which are abused because unknown, will accomplish more good
than half a dozen teachers of higher pretensions, and lower ability. It
was gratifying to observe the decorum&mdash;the sense of respect for
both speaker and subject, that was observed throughout the evening,
which evidently shows that those who go there are actuated by higher
motives than mere curiosity; by desires more ennobling than a passing
gratification; in a word, it was clear that those who composed Dr.
H.'s hearers, were men who know and dare to think, and who will profit
by these most useful discourses.&mdash;<cite>New York Herald, Aug. 7,
1844.</cite></p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p><span class="smcap">The Origin of Life.</span>&mdash;We attended
Dr. Hollick's Lecture at the Masonic Hall, on Monday evening, and
if we were to say we were delighted, we should but feebly express
the gratification we experienced. It was, in fact, a whole series
of anatomical lectures crowded into one, and that one so divested
of technicalities, and rendered so concise, so intelligible to the
most illiterate mind, and withal couched in such delicate as well as
perspicuous language, that the most fastidious could find no fault, nor
the idlest curiosity go away uninformed. The<span class="pagenum"><a

not only an accurate counterpart of nature, but can be taken apart,
opened, examined, &amp;c., with an ease that renders the study as
perfect as an actual dissection, without the <em>desagremens</em>
that attend a scrutiny of the real subject. We advise all who
love knowledge, and particularly a knowledge of their physical
organization, to attend these lectures.&mdash;<cite>Phila. Spirit of

<p>At a Meeting of the Class attendant upon Dr. Hollick's Select
Lectures on the Physiology and Philosophy of the "Origin of Life" in
Plants and Animals, held at the Lecture Room of the Museum, Wednesday
evening, December 1, 1844, George G. West, Esq., was called to the
Chair, and Samuel W. Black appointed Secretary.</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we have listened with unfeigned pleasure
and interest to the Course of Lectures delivered by Dr. Hollick, and
now brought to a close, and that we deem it an act of justice to him
and the community, to express our entire confidence in his character,
ability, and the manner of illustrating his subject, which, to use
the words of a daily journal, "is couched in such delicate as well as
perspicuous language, that the most fastidious could find no fault, nor
the idlest curiosity go away unimproved."</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That a committee of three be appointed to tender
to Dr. H. the thanks of the Class for his courtesy to the members
in affording them every facility for obtaining information upon the
subject of his Lectures, and that he be requested to repeat the Course
at the earliest period consistent with his other engagements.</p>

the following Resolutions were unanimously adopted, and ordered to be
published in one or more of the city papers:</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we have listened with great pleasure and
interest to Dr. Hollick's Lectures, and are happy to add our testimony
to the many already recorded in behalf of such Lectures: and regarding
Dr. Hollick as a benefactor of his race, and especially of our sex,
we cordially wish for him abundant success, and ample reward in the
consciousness of doing good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick's Lectures.</span>&mdash;These
Lectures continue to attract much attention, and are commended by all
who hear them. During the past week Dr. H. has given a private Lecture
and exhibition of his models to many of our prominent Senators and
public men, all of whom expressed themselves highly gratified, and
desirous that another class should be formed to accommodate their
friends who had not attended.&mdash;<cite>National Intelligencer, Jan.
30, 1846.</cite></p>


<hr class="r5small" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick</span> is a gentleman of no less
knowledge in his profession than eloquence in his means of imparting
it, and he is certainly deserving of great credit and support for his
exertions in a new field of such universal importance. We commend
these Lectures with the fullest confidence to the attention of our
citizens.&mdash;<cite>N. Y. Sun, Aug. 6, 1845.</cite></p>

<p class="center">"<small>LETTERS FROM NEW YORK, NO.</small> 11."</p>

<p>" * * * * There have been several courses of Lectures on Anatomy,
this winter, adapted to popular comprehension. I rejoice at this; for
it has long been a cherished wish with me that a general knowledge
of the structure of our bodies, and the laws which govern it, should
extend from the scientific few into the common education of the people.
I know of nothing so well calculated to diminish vice and vulgarity
as universal and rational information on these subjects. But the
impure state of society has so perverted nature, and blinded common
sense, that intelligent women, though eagerly studying the structure
of the Earth, the attraction of the Planets, and the reproduction of
Plants, seem ashamed to know anything of the structure of the human
Body, and of those Physiological facts most intimately connected with
their deepest and purest emotions, and the holiest experience of their
lives. I am often tempted to say, as Sir C. Grandison did to the
Prude&mdash;'Wottest thou not how much <em>in</em>-delicacy there is in
thy delicacy?'</p>

<p>"The only Lectures I happened to attend were those of Dr. Hollick,
which interested and edified me much. They were plain, familiar
conversations, uttered and listened to with great modesty of language,
and propriety of demeanor. The Manikin, or Artificial Anatomy, by which
he illustrated his subject, is a most wonderful machine invented by
a French Physician. It is made of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier
mache</i>, and represents the human body with admirable perfection, in
the shape, coloring, and arrangement, even to the minutest fibres. By
the removal of wires it can be dissected completely, so as to show
the locality and functions of the various Organs, the interior of the
Heart, Lungs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Until I examined this curious piece of mechanism, I had very faint
and imperfect ideas of the miraculous machinery of the house we live
in. I found it highly suggestive of many things to my mind." * * *</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick's Lectures.</span>&mdash;We

<p class="center"><cite>From the New York Herald.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outlines of Anatomy and Physiology, with a
Dissecting Plate or the Human Organization</span>, by Frederick
Hollick, M. D. We regard this as one of the most valuable works issued
in a long time. It is a complete general treatise on anatomy and
physiology, and the dissected plate answers the purpose of a model
of the human frame. Dr. Hollick is entitled to great credit for his
laudable desire to disseminate a knowledge of subjects that are of such
vital consequence to all, but which hitherto has been monopolized by
the medical profession. We commend it to all as a work of great merit
and usefulness.</p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p class="center"><cite>From the Patriot, Baltimore, March 24th,
1847.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outlines of Anatomy</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;Dr.
F. Hollick, whose history as the great <em>simplifier</em> of the
human anatomy, so well known throughout the country, and whose public
Lectures have won for him so high a reputation, has just published
a work which he designates "Outlines of Anatomy and Physiology for
Popular Use." This book contains a very curiously and ingeniously
arranged plate, which opens by pieces, so that the different parts
of the organs of the human system may be seen in all their variety,
all of which are fully explained in English. The second part of this
invaluable work gives a general description of these organs and
parts of the system, under the division of bones, muscles, arteries,
veins, &amp;c., &amp;c. This work should fall into the hands of every
family.</p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p class="center"><cite>From the New York Argus, January 9, 1847.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neuropathy.</span>&mdash;This is a new name,
but a good one, being the title of a work by Dr. F. Hollick, whose
excellent Lectures on various subjects will be remembered by many
of our citizens. In this work is explained the action of Galvanism,
Electricity and Magnetism; Homœopathy and Allopathy are contrasted
in theory and practice; Mesmerism is discussed, and other subjects
"too numerous to mention," treated in a manner at once novel and
instructive. Dr. Hollick has also published a work on "Anatomy and
Physiology for Popular Use," illustrated with a new dissected plate of
the human organization, of most ingenious construction. Of this work we
shall have more to say anon. It is no ordinary production.</p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p class="center"><cite>From the New York Sunday Times and Messenger,

<p>"<span class="smcap">Outlines of Anatomy and Physiology, for
popular use</span>," illustrated by a new dissected plate of the human
organization, and by separate views. The work is designed either to
convey a general knowledge of these subjects in itself, or as a key for
explaining larger and more complete works. These Outlines should be in
the hands of every body; and Dr. Hollick, or any one else, is a public
benefactor who furthers the publication of such able, interesting, and
truly important works.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>From the Pennsylvanian, (Philadelphia,) Jan.
26, 1847.</cite></p>

<p>The following in regard to two works from the pen of Dr. Hollick,
of this city, we copy from the Washington Union, of the 20th
instant:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outlines of Anatomy and Physiology for
popular use.</span> <i>By Frederick Hollick, M. D., Lecturer on
Anatomy, Physiology, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;We regard this as an eminently
useful publication. It gives in a form far more condensed and
intelligible than we have before seen, a very comprehensive view of
the human organization. The dissected plate of the human anatomy,
which forms an interesting feature of the work, is to us at least a
novelty. The explanations are drawn up with great simplicity, and
cannot be misunderstood by the general reader, while they, with the
illustrations, will often serve to render more clear and precise the
views of scientific and professional students.</p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p class="center"><cite>From the Sunday Mercury, New York.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick's Last Work</span>&mdash;<cite>The
Diseases of Woman, their Causes and Cure familiarly explained, with
Practical Hints for their prevention, &amp;c.</cite>&mdash;We regard
this as an invaluable production, the most useful, in many respects,
which has yet emanated from this distinguished author and practitioner.
It is just the kind of work which has ever been wanted, and is just
suitable to the excellent purpose for which it was intended; this
it accomplishes most fully, and its extensive circulation must be
productive of vast practical benefit. It is works of this nature and
<span class="smcap">CHARACTER</span> which really do good; which
exhibit plain facts in a plain manner, and record in language simple
and intelligible, knowledge of the most vital importance to the health
and consequent happiness of every daughter, sister, wife, and mother
in the land. The work is dedicated to the <span class="smcap">Ladies
of America</span>, and we congratulate them upon the possession of
a friend at once so able, so sincere and valuable as Dr. Hollick.
Burgess, Stringer &amp; Co., of this city, are the publishers.</p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p class="center"><cite>The New York Sun says of this Book</cite>:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Burgess &amp; Stringer</span> have just issued
a most invaluable work, being a treatise upon the diseases of women,
by the celebrated Dr. Hollick. We have thoroughly examined the work,
and can say without hesitation, that it should be in the hands of every
mother who cares for the health of her daughters, and every woman who
values physical and mental well-being. Dr. Hollick and his publishers
have done a public benefit by issuing such a book."</p>

<hr class="r5small" />


<p class="center"><cite>From the New York Sunday Times.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick's</span> great work, <span
class="smcap">The Diseases of Woman</span>, which will be found
advertised in another column, is truly a valuable production, and
well sustains the author's well-earned reputation. It is a complete
practical treatise on female diseases, scientific enough for a
medical man, and yet so plain that every body can understand it, and
so delicately written that even the most fastidious cannot object
to a single passage. Much of the matter it contains is quite new in
this country, even to medical men, and of the greatest interest and
importance. The anatomical plates are superb, and the whole book is
excellently got up. Every adult female in the land should read this
book; the information it gives would prevent an incalculable amount of
disease and suffering, if possessed in time; or it will teach the best
way to cure it when unfortunately established.</p>

<p>This is the most complete, and at the same time most simple work
ever issued on the subject. It is illustrated in a novel manner,
by a <em>large colored Plate</em> of the Human Organization, which
<em>dissects</em> by means of separate layers, <em>from the surface of
the Abdomen down to the Spine</em>, showing all the Organs in their
proper places, all connected together, and many of them in sections!
the whole being colored to life. This plate is on an entire new plan,
nothing of the kind having ever before been invented; it is almost as
complete as a model, and is invaluable for private study, for teachers,
and for Medical students. The explanations are familiar, and divested
of technicalities: and it is still further illustrated by separate
wood-cuts throughout the work, and a beautifully engraved portrait on
Steel of the author. One volume, quarto, bound, price One Dollar. Third
Edition.</p>

Medical students. The favor they have already met with, and the
extensive circulation they have attained, is proof that they both meet
the wants of the public and enjoy its approbation.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>From the Boston Mail, March 7, 1848.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hollick's Separate Lectures to Ladies and
Gentlemen on Physiology.</span>&mdash;The importance of adult persons,
of both sexes, understanding themselves, and their natural relations,
must be obvious to every thinking mind. The present ignorance on these
matters is, undoubtedly, the chief cause of the vices and sufferings
which so extensively prevail, and our only hope of a beneficial
change must be founded on a proper system of public instruction. This
instruction is difficult to impart we admit, and there are but few
men qualified for imparting it. We have no hesitation, however, in
saying that Dr. H. is one of these men. He knows how to preserve in his
subject all that intense interest which it intrinsically possesses,
and yet to divest it of everything in the slightest degree obnoxious
to censure, or even distrust. He has a happy faculty of making every
thing easy to be understood, and yet avoiding the slightest approach to
undue familiarity. All who attend, express themselves both surprised
and delighted, and unhesitatingly recommend his Lectures wherever they
go. Many of the most eminent Ladies in our city were among his auditors
last week, and were unreserved in their expressions of approbation,
both for the Lecture itself, and for the becoming modesty and true
refinement that characterised its delivery. The present series, which
commence to-day, has been anxiously expected, and will no doubt be
numerously attended by both sexes, but particularly by the Ladies, many
of whom were unable to gain admission last week.</p>
